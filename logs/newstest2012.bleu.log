libya 's victory
the story of libya 's liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .
parliament n' has not ratifié l' amendment for the him of tymosenko
parliament ukrainien has dragged in the context d' one amendment to the law pénal , the draft d' annulation of the paragraph relatif to l' inculpation of julia tymosenko , the leader l' opposition .
the members have dragged at second reading the draft amendment working reducing peines for délits economic , which might have been opened the portes the freedom to l' ex-première secretary currently emprisonnée .

it might fallu 226 votes for l' endorse .
success libyenne
the him or rebellion libyenne has already its vaincus .
muammar kaddafi is enterré in a place inconnu in the désert and without him the guerre is terminée .
it remains to be seen vainqueurs .
as it is coutume in the area , vainqueurs to taking are the islamistes , but s' agit-il of modérés or radicaux .
the council has décrété provisoire national law habituel of the charia and we already know from it s' is .
the libye meaning a country without criminalité because for a changeover it coupe hand .
women can responsibility l' émancipation , not respectueuses éventuelles dela faith are passibles the ago capitale ...
c' is the coran which is going unir to the place of the personnalité the dictateur society composée of tribus opposées .
in libye règnera a follow-up agenda as we do not the représenter and as we n' aimerions sûrement not .
but our way of vivre n' is not unique , n' is not objectivement the better and would not avantageuse probability for the libyens .
it is especially étonnant that the guerriers islamistes have accepté l' aid with acknowledgement of chiens infidèles .
the only excuse c' is that this n' is not a general américian which dirigeait the frappes of l' otan but rather than allah which they célébraient the grandeur to each attaque .
when it s' is therefore of seek the vainqueurs in libye , l' occident n' in fact not part
we took to tirs , servi l' islam and our poilitiques have declared détournés the dictateur as qu' allié policy without that this n' amène lasting .
after the récentes mauvaises expériences of l' afghanistan and l' irak , we n' dealing not militairement the libye .
it n' there is therefore no problem for the local is débarasser of " croisés ".
est-ce that without occupation of sol , the pétrolières societies auront facilement accés to l' well noir libyien .
perhaps not enforcement and l' occident able surely is vanter d' a protection desintéressée the right of l' homme .
for little that we will empêchent these adeptes of the charia .

alimentation l' d' a enfant obèse : does not of small step déjeuner not and takes the charcuterie for the dîner
more d' one third of enfants of 9 to 13 years have problems of surpoids , 9% of écoliersont a poids on - dessus the average and 5% are obèses .
as the montrent the recherches drawn the enfants obèses proviennent of familles which have a style of life malsain .
this indicates once again to quel point is important areas in which decide l' person and the macroeconomic which l' entourent .
on the tables of enfants obèses it trouve example of the charcuterie 50% more often in the familles d' enfants on poids normal .
19% of obèses had of frites on dîner according l' enquête undertaken with a action of sensibilisation " l' obésité n' is not coincidentally "
in the familles of petits worst the sport n' is also not a habitude which is now the case of most of the écoliers d' today - only 15% previously qu' at least a time by week the parents trouvaient the time for the mouvement active .
enquête undertaken on 900 enfants
enquête l' s' is déroulée during the last year scolaire and have took 900 élèves of écoles primaires of tchéquie .
c' was the second édition of " l' obésité n' is not coincidentally ", action soutenue by l' requisite insurance general health and society unilever .
since the start c' is more of 12000 élèves of sixth to the third which are inscrits to this project .
l' a factors déterminants which provoquent a terrible increased the number enfants d' in surpoids , thus obèses , is l' lack , d' a alimentation correct and not d' exercise physique .
" only the of enfants questionnés indicated by example manger 5 time by small step off déjeuner-en case - déjeuner - goûter dîner , which is l' a principles of basis d' a good alimentation ", indicated l' a outcome of l' enquête .
without small step déjeuner and charcuterie on dîner
the spécialistes attirent l' attention that not a development sain must be a few details concerning basis qu' such a small step déjeuner in famille to the same now .
in tchéquie , only 23% of familles of élèves mangent to the my even now .
in the major part of familles each takes its small step déjeuner only .
and the pire which has been relevé is qu' a dixième the population , does not of any of small step déjeuner .
the small step déjeuner is however the basis d' a good alimentation everyday .
the questionnaire has shown that in the familles of enfants obèses it consomme more often of frites malsaines .
almost each élève - without discussing the poids - boit each item of boissons sucrées ( 70% ).
more 40% of enfants questionnés done the sport again and again but for the parents it s' is of the , only 15% .
prepare toi ton alimentation
another part of l' enquête has enabled to enfants choisis ( 204 garçons and 172 filles of 13 écoles ) of préparer its own alimentation something opportunities proposées according to their own goût and their opinion interpretation .
" the préférences of enfants tchèques of 12 to 15 years are loin , on plan d' a alimentation saine , l' idéal ".
among their plats préférés there very gâteaux , viandes and sucreries .
" the more alarmant is particularly a great préférence for the limonades sucrées ", is indiqué in the results of enquête l' .
for the déjeuner are pâtes which have taken the first place juste towards viande blanche .
the enfants n' have not just the voulu of féculents and the préférence for the poissons and repas of légumes was limited .
cap on health
enquête l' has also shown that the enfants are prepared to changer their habitudes something the time when they reçoivent the environmental ad hoc transportation .
" d' during a supervision d' a group of participants to l' enquête which had rempli the questionnaire after the sitting of sensibilisation " obésité n' is not coincidentally ", was assité to a willingness very déterminée of is diriger towards a alimentation saine ", indiquent the results of l' enquête .
the more marquant has been example far limonades sucrées because the enfants have commencé to give the préférence to water l' consumer .
the enfants have the more often coché on the questionnaire the viande blanche and poissons as plat main and réduiraient the plats sucrés and " knedliky " ( spécialté tchèque of boulettes of farine of pain or pommes of exile ).
the styliste must be also a right psychologue , disent the professionnels
in a rule of relatif presentation to the way d' apprendre for the stylistes , i am implementation somewhat in colère the fact qu' there in had many therefore the start .
i do not pensais to what allait achieve by light .
the exposés of three professionnels of the spécialité , l' habillement of personnages and a seminar on what is happening there .
and it will pire .
more we approchons of examinations finaux and more we attendent of exercices practical and environmental .
and even when there has during the samedis and dimanches c' is véritablement " bourré ".
this time we have with the directrice alenka ( during it n' there without garçon ) of the treaty habiller manner the femme which n' has not of mensurations standards .
and women of this type c' is the majority .
l' a has a small step cou , l' other a until of garçon , without courbe should , another of the surpoids .
the styliste must know how optiquement ammenuiser of bras broad , merely prolongs a cou either rajouter of courbes produced .
we are arrivées well to highlight joliment the personnage and also to do not habiller manner too voyante of types of women as jennifer lopez with a forte poitrine and hanches prononcées and a fine scale .
s' there for example a différence between the scale and the hanches in such a way that the jupes or pantalons do not passent the everything , this nonetheless worth the coup of safety do do tailor-made .
and you do the regretterez not because l' habillement which tombe impeccablement is inestimable .
in a jupe tailor-made you sentirez very much better in amongst which glisse in permanence , s' enroule and do not impression to the ceinture and well of light .
for which actually have a face masculine have can take enable a habillement of style tucker , with the morceaux of tissus cousus , either the broderies .
there has of course many d' examples d ' apparences diverses and i am contente that j' i have any the week for trier all environmental reçues .
but j' i have also peur qu' held connection to what i dois do to the maison there in has too .
each stagiaire reçut a célébrité to habiller for the item and the soirée .
we need take into consideration l' face stand , the type of method of the personnalité that his face .
i devrai " habiller " kerr miranda , perhaps you connaissez of areas the secret of victoria .
the form of thinking , as i have plaisir , because c' is better that d' habiller britney spears , christina aguilera which has taken almost cent kilos these latest time ( do not prenez my included , svp , complètement on serious ) or the 34 selena gomez .
we need couper and coudre something of magazines or seek on the internet , establishing and working the graphisme .
the moodboard , as it said for the final result , speaking our style known that our integration with the creation graphique .
also reflect on the part of the graphique styling is also important .
the styliste n' habille well not only the physique but creates for example the pages productives in the magazines ( on of products donnés the harmful for the sacs to hand , the manteaux , etc. ...).
kamenik mario , styliste and graphiste , we did entretenu of all this .
but this ,... jusqu'au dimanche
the styliste must be an vision general
three attach the spécialité have given a deal diversifié to the sitting of samedi remplie d' environmental on the various types of personnages .
honza pokorny , styliste , jakub polanka graphiste of fashion and ben renc , photographe of method .
we jakub has reminded that the method is a illusion and the styliste should know l' spent .
and a styliste of talent know working with only habillement of different manner .
the variabilité is for this example primordial .
as for example this trench-coat which must be porté d' manner classique with a jean and a t-shirt as a manteau léger but also it can habiller also the until nu , with the escarpins and take into photo as an robe .
either we alone of remonter the manches or the col and immédiatement a new look .
" jouez with this " any pointed out .
but j' i particularly apprécié the council line : " for the work you need to finding the rules ". upon
" you pouvez then start to there contrevenir ", has said jakub .
finally i comprends why it s' efforce d' apprendre these rules , from do with , towards from , why , considering that in the magazines of method that voit sometimes accomplished d' other .
no included on the défilés of method .
i know again , through the photographe of method ben that the styliste must be very much more variantes d' habillement that those who are photographiées .
c' is to say that for fashion story which will take a dizaine of pages ( a dizaine of macroeconomic ) i dois be prepared to by retailler " at least a quinzaine .
and also , a vêtement and its combinaison with d' other elements apparaissent complètement différemment qu' in fact .
we need confident with this during d' a necessary d' a model .
that l' image and the style refuse sometimes the the succés we has been confirmé by honza pokorny .
it alone of regarder madonna which n' is not a super chanteuse but his image and the marketing in have done a mondiale star .
in tchéquie , l' approach towards l' use services of stylistes still frileuse .
and the visages connus the considèrent sometimes as unnecessary ( it alone that i connaisse accomplished but i parais happening in the second rang ).
and if quelqu'un is done to a styling of our hand , then we need to be confident done qu' we dicte with a great probabilité a scale complètement different ( more small ) than qu' he has in fact .
we still then qu' to naviguer on google and assure s' if the infos of boulevard refuse to the célébrité in question , if it has maigri or grossi etc. ...
honza and mario we have posé dimanche on the coeur qu ' it will no longer simply not on styliste of s' direction in the method and know assembler of macroeconomic .
it must communiquer with the people qu' it habille and it is well important d' be a right psychologue .
know deviner people , do not take flatter , conserver his opinion .
" when a manager urge you to combat trier his armoire and the remplir new elements you do not pouvez all jeter and him say , my dieu what horreur ."
" you trouverez few affaires that you trouverez jolies and combat that you conseillerez with from the brought up ", said mario .
surely we has shown in particular what must contenir what l' we call the " placovka " or sac the styliste .
c' is that you accrochez focused on the scale and that you on itself for everything which you need .
furthermore something clearly summit as the ciseaux , the rouleaux for dépilation either still the épingles to nourrice , it trouve also of the fil of nylon ( that the styliste utilise for photographier of products as of sacs , or very chapeaux ), of clips spéciaux with which we ferme a vêtement in the expense , s' it is too great ( l' épingle or other type d' agrafe are not utlisables because they pourraient abîmer the vêtement ) either a kit of couture .
for that we soyions not only of people who écoutent but which have attempted accomplished manner practice they have enseigné how ressemeller correctly of chaussures .
and during the sitting photo in l' atelier where the surface is égale , the semelle may s' abîmer , to fortiori to lextérieur .
and well we have collé and collé .
we n' had not the right of toucher the ciseaux for do not take blesser by inadvertance .
it must therefore véritablement of competences .
m' mario has done plaisir lorsqu'il m' has félicité for my creation .
the comptence which i fais state n' is not for my copine .
this is only a small step résumé of what we have appris during the second week-end of during
i commence more and more to comprendre that ensure styling a profession n' is not a promenade in a jardin of roses , that each in dise this qu' it wishes .
the needs vitesse the run is dispute to travers any l' america .
revision
has l' districts a course without problem is transforme to commend d' a whole d' erreurs stupides of people who n' in have nothing to do in a déplacement matinal routinier work .
this remplit until a certain extent l' urgency of each but this does sert to nothing if someone n' has envie to be accomplished more .
the new part sous-titrée the run has product of great expectations before its enforceable .
it promettait of take a new directorate with the kinds of course need for speed already âgée and sortir a way of jeu something of parties jouables which do compterait not only with points .
we were therefore curieux how seem to be the rajoutés passages in desquels the main héros sort of its voiture and done this qu' it has envie .
as this is already done in the great deal nfs , the result is complètement other that this that l' it atttendait .
this is potentiellement of jeux of course d' arcades but l' whole presents towards the bas to commend of certain fautes unnecessary which already exist since several years .
this are not really of erreurs but rather than l' " d' a fainéantise incompréhensible the proportion of the développeurs .
aventure l' commence very .
you êtes taken in l' aventure which the main héros jack has problems caractériels and for the régler is met to participate in of courses illegal to travers l' america .
you asseyez derrière the volant on the ships ouest to san francisco and your mission is d' achieve the first to new york .
l' idea has intéressants elements .
itinéraire l' is divisé in ten étapes and then more 50 courses .
this which résulte that each course is done on a other itinéraire and étapes prévues in environnements various which distinguent quite only sides of other and are intéressants .
the joueur n' has not only the opinion a moment that the jeu him proposes accomplished d' identique .
some environnements are of surcroit quite jolis even if the technical graphique level is the same type that the séries précédentes .
to conclude this n' is not the bout of the world .
but the conduct to travers the désert , in paysages d' automne either in montagnes hautement enneigées is very agréable visuellement .
the épreuves are more time in time agrémentées d' a élement atypique .
for example in the désert you retrouvez in a tempête of sable which you diminue manner sensitive the visibilité .
then in the montagnes you do devez attention to this qu' a avalanche do you tombe not dessus .
has to say this the various courses are agencées the unes derrière .
there , only a small step qu' number , but this alone .
there of moment ago you efforcez of surpasser the number requested d' adversaires ( as in a course classique ) can tell you courrez against the signs ( duel classique with the chronomètre ) and then you still attend a other duel with a adversaire .
time in time you also the police which between in the jeu and which is endeavouring to you make the situation dificile .
the nouveauté are the passages hors véhicule .
it s' is rather than d' una community action groups interactive when the most of the time s' jack enfuit face quelqu'un and you devez l' assist in tapant on the right bouton at the right time .
nothing of complicated .
what is surprenant c' is qu' there has less moments of this type that what you attendez ( for personally it n' there , that three ).
the result c' is as because this élément do not military of gêner and is place in the ways décrit ci-dessus , in the elements which agrémentent the jeu .
the model of conduct is in the tradition of jeux précédents .
in other words , what qu' currently it n' there has nothing d' extraordinaire but can not say that this should be négatif .
for this simulation realistic you devrez goes improve indeed .
but that l' it such solutions better in the conccurrence the model of conduct going very with the type of attitude of courses .
therefore all is ok .
the problems commencent to apparaître after a pity time .
has the diffférence the model of conduct , telecommunications collisions n' is not yet the point .
we do not n' of this jeu a déformation compliquée and collisions , but when you n' you did not , during d' a collision with n' important quel decide , the quite frank idea of the is comporte your auto , this n' is therefore not complètement right .
during the dépassements serrés you touchez occasionally mutuellement légèrement but your words auto hand in voltiges folles .
either is retrouve in miettes .
through the system of redémarrage this n' is not really a problem , but this agace you really .
the redémarrage is done manner to this that when you êtes cassé the figure or you êtes sorti in the décor the jeu you ramène when the final point on l' itinéraire .
but you do disposez only that of 5 redémarrages .
when you utilisé the 5 redémarrages you devez recommencer the jeu since the start .
c' is therefore more a tool , for the case where accomplished does not happening as it must , that quelquechose on which you pouvez véritablement confident .
occasionally the redémarrages n' providing not and must strike the solution in is remémorrant of mémoire the morceau d' itinéraire in question .
the great hic of this jeu c' is that the same action is retrouvent in the same lieux .
for example , there is some virages qu' it must passer d' a certain way otherwise this does not happening .
you rencontrez words on a place given of tankers " civils " always the same configuration that you arriviez first , fifthly , 5 limited in advance or a minute late .
what met in colère are enormous when you see passer facilement l' adversaire between two voitures venant in sense inverse when you arrivez , you , you must be is set to say and conturner either apply a brake .
c' is égal if you allez on - face of him because c' is " calculé " in such a way that for the situation given the opportunity it will arrive always closely of your nez .
the adversaires have still d' other avantages .
all during the time of the jeu , you , you arrivez in some endroits , once again without is soucier the time , and you always the same adversaire which you mind in the same place .
this énerve the more in the end jeu when you roulez on a long pont in inverse sense .
adversaire l' must to all prices passer face you .
when it happening face you it you cache the view of other tankers in sense inverse and you entrez in collision a right number of times .
one can comprendre that the objective of this jeu is to be accomplished of captivant and plein d' adrédaline , but it is clear that you ennuyez rapidly .
and c' is because the travers d' a model of conduct simple the jeu is interesting and endroits with both d' action that you n' you did not the time to monitor all what is happening .
and c' is égal if c' is to commend the expression of 50 itinéraires uniques , that l' order of courses is employ qu' there no chance of s' ennuyer either accomplished d' other .
originale l' idea is the change of voiture during the courses .
you do devez attention to pompes to essence on the itinéraires because you pouvez there changer of voiture however , most of the time amongst that you you alone .
the voitures are divisées in three catégories .
the voitures of sport are idéales for the cities , the grosses cylindrées ltcm for the autoroutes droites and super voitures of sport to atours exotiques on the conduites very techniques for example on the roads in lacet in the montagnes .
and the method of challenges , which are courses in endroits particuliers that you connaissez of l' aventure , going very with the main régime of l' histoire .
you recevez not only of médailles but also of points d' experience which s' ajoutent your profil which is common to the challenges and l' aventure .
when you reached as safe as conducteur , various objets commencent to take déverrouiller :
surely is connecte on-line with the civil autolog which between other compare your results established with those d' other joueurs and you procurent d' other fonctions in the community .
one of the most l' coups hard to comprendre is the situation of the last course of l' aventure .
you arrivez with your voiture in the tauern métro ( ça ressemble ) where you roulez in l' obscurité on the ( ça ressemble ).
your indicateur of vitesse you indicated between 150 and 200 km/heure ( to a priori ) and derrière you arrive a rame of métro which you envoie the voiture directly to the ferraille .
has the wording we held a few jours during brought to know if quelqu'un has certainly réfléchi during the creation of this jeu or so if the auteurs we really above for of imbéciles .
the proposals technical nature of the jeu n' is not extra , but the proposals visuelle is general rules agréable and in some instances truly super .
what gêne c' is in situations more extrêmes , l' imagerie do not impression standards and in some instances of tragique manner .
this involves especially accidents with a large number of participants when a imagerie fluide do you sert more to nothing .
the proposals sonore is good and the piste is the offer .
in the objective of plaire on more large number and particularly the more the public 34 a new piste sonore has been créée in the style " i mélange all ", but can s' attendre to this that someone n' achètera the jeu for the musique .
the impression general need for speed : the run is therefore truly confus .
if the jeu n' had not these stupides erreurs we pourrions say without crainte qu' it s' is the better production of nfs recent years .
but this jeu gives the impression l' not to be fini .
l' amusement is truly very but préparez to you that the fautes you tapent in the feel with the power d' a réflecteur d' aérodrome .

histoire d' a indication :
innovateur l' ibm commence the second century of his denominator
if quelqu'un adhere to seek the vocable speaking on more closely the strategy ibm , the more proche would " the long term ".
for a public widest ibm is the symbole of the révolution technological , is a firme ressentie as very stand and however since its necessary it is s' been cent years .
the basis for this strategy to long term has been jetée by the first leader of the firme , the visionnaire thomas j. watson sr .
it has laissé this slogan a large number of problems mondiaux may be réglés for little that people are désireux of reflect .
his slogan " pense' hat off grew l' empreinte focused which is going to develop the life d' a forthcoming géant ( and also under the magazine interne that ibm commença to éditer in 1935 ).
c' was the basis of the culture of l' business soignement élaborée by watson .
for we ibm mean a thinking here to long term of mouvements ongoing dirigés towards the forthcoming .
ibm has survécu cent years through the fact qu' it resta always fidèle to its valeurs basic and however did not peur of changer all the other focused d' it .
this we ensured in our first century of transformer the technologie , business and society .
we hope that in the second century we atteindrons even more " has délaré for l' anniversaire l' taught us directeur of the firme samuel j. palmisano .
a system very préparé
watson , in the years trente , will mit to s' focus of its employés as bata in the federal tchèque - the people of ibm were the investment among the premiers employés américains to be the festive payées , a requisite insurance payée by l' employeur more a uniforme d' employé élégant and a system very developed of récompenses for the inventeurs and commmerciaux .
the same way ibm has a sytème of institutional with the customer very developed .
society was at the start géniale in the découverte of talents as l' of the initial firmes to be aboli any forme of discrimination and could well be the offer .
the plan taught us is complètement in l' spirit of the strategy anti-discriminatoire since this will be a femme virginia rometty - which should substitute palmisano to the top d' ibm .
order works here ibm since trente years and representing currently the poste of leader of ventes , marketing and the strategy .
ibm in the past few years have what l' we call the jamy , of the brain storming in keeping something from are issues very strategies responsibilities and innovations .
it n' is not étonnant qu' it has many d' produce - in the firme there closely of 500000 people who travaillent .
a institution with a right behalf
c' is l' image interne and externe of l' company which him publicity position safe in the fields of affaires .
" since the start ibm were a expression rather than d' institution d' a firme technological ", disait rosabeth moss kanter , professeur d' economy to l' ecole d' harvard economy and the author of white on ibm .
" ibm n' is not a firme technlogique but a firme which aid to solving the problems of the world of business using its technologie ", ajoutait geogre colony of the firme of consulting forrester research .
as the said the firme proceed there a différence between entrer on the market and create this market .
ibm - or so the " great bleue ", as it s' next familièrement to etats unis held connection to his slogan in cent years she has grandi until believe l' a of great firmes mondiales .
c' is of course the firme technological the more polyvalente - it développe of logiciels , hardwares , times over , hébergement , services of council in terms of products of the serveur until the nanotechnologie .
it possède many brevets of all the firmes technologiques ltcm and five of its employés have received a nobel prices .
among its découvertes is range for example the distributeur of billets , the counted of paiement , the swap tunnel , the code barre or the disquette .
s' ibm is retrouvée this year with 220 billion dollars of the second more firme technological according to the market capitalisation ( the first is apple ), when for the first time it dépassa in 1996 microsoft .
aperçu in advance
this are not all innovations and fabrications which have held the préférence the customer and ibm l' époque - for example n' has not réussi the pari on a system opérationnel own os/2 , of the service prodige in keeping either of l' ordinateur ibm pcjr :
" has reference time when your business is bâti on the mouvement in advance you do not pouvez émotionellement leave accrochés on the past , " remarked samuel j. palmisano .
for this n' ibm has no problem for build its simply on very plates-formes when they do not fonctionnent it s' in doubt .
has there for example of the conccurent microsoft which to the basis is impression and demeure under the system opérationnel windows .
a technologie context
in the incomes ibm , the services , which are formés for a fifth by the logiciels and hardwares , have a place prépondérante .
however , still in 1990 it was with more of the motié participation by the strong more représentant of hardware .
has something l' year 2000 ibm has vendu of actifs to modest return for 15 billion of dollars , during cettre period she has investi 58 billion of dollars in l' achat of technologies allow .
it further education in invest and even something 2008 when for the first time she has surpassé the new financial crise .
négocie ibm according to the préceptes of his first leader thomas j. watson , which in great crise economic has also cases his volume d' invest .
it apparait submitting that ibm happening the crise stand up be inquiétée ?
the prices of l' action ibm has progessé something 2008 in fusée of 120 pourcent , the good net of the firme further education to faster .
the logo of the firme ibm is of changer all but not its valeurs .
one can s' attendre for this that this géant flexible maitrise d' other crises .

ivette tu could garder this âne , i wish n' in more !

rychtirova n' is not intéressée of with which his mari couche .
if rychtar and bartosova is séparent it n' there will not d' épouse for l' accueillir on the not the something of the maison .
c' " is the père biologique of my fils and s' it wishes closing life in our common maison , no the mettra outside ".
" it will more my vieil âne aimé and perdu , but a homme with which i have j' integration should ", has laissé filtrer rychtarova in showing qu' it s' is détachée of his mari but qu' they still only in a décente integration .

the pires vices of women : this you far too ?
if you demandez to men regard of vices typiques of women , all sides , as the other , are capables of the sortir " of their manche ".
my chères dames , you allez in parts of the suivantes of vices féminins which come to pomper the sang of veines of men .
the achats
your moitié you have the comments that you êtes dépendante of achats ?
devez you acheter at least a vêtement by week ?
you êtes contente d' acheter and by paquets when of soldes ?
in your case can discuss the achats as a vice .
some women thought qu' they should restreindre their passion to of achats .
but you direz , which résisterait on lèche-vitrine of magasins of vêtements , to seek to soi-même of jolis vêtements and then the essayer all in cabine ( l' idéal of couleurs various )?
and that for the majority of women acheter be a hobby , this can believe for l' homme a real province .
rappelez you only combien of time you you said in your conjoint qu' it attende to l' entry ...
insatisfaction constante
" i am not too grosse "?
" j' set needs maigrir at least of 5 kilos - i devrais start to ensure sport ?"
" i te plais ?"
these phrases do you not rappellent-elles accomplished ?
yes ?
you made therefore part of these women who are obsédées by their face .
this n' is not the question that you devriez cesser of you focus of yourself but a large number allergique d' men is the fact that their partenaire be always in late of is plaindre of his face .
the sexe strong n' not reluctant to say that more the fréquence of these plaintes increase and more women they empoisonnantes .
odre l' and the propreté to the first place
c' is as a manège infini .
laver the fenêtres , passer l' aspirateur , nettoyer the sols , do the poussière , décaper the salle of bains - and this two time by week .
you made the comments to your partenaire qu' it day with of feet sales on the sol own , to enfants qu' they have sali the lavabo , encrassé the vitre of the salle of séjour , and it gives very work ?
the case where you souffrez precisely this obsession , essayez d' be to l' spirit qu' it must nothing exagérer and that l' agenda and the propreté must not be to the first place in the famille .
this inoffensif désir of propreté can but gâcher your institutional and even the paix familiale .
the work of sape
" met this survêtement usé to the poubelle ".
" tu comptes set these vieilles chaussettes still tomorrow ?"
" a serviette mouillée n' has nothing to do with ". exile
if you made on your partenaire this work of sape of this manner several times by off , you allez truly the décomposer .
it is genuine link that you do not pensez to mal you permit that everything is as it should impeccable .
perhaps that if the savaient men , women n' really not to both of work of sape ...
the diffamation , the persiflage
the diffamation , the persiflage but also the insultes against quelqu'un are also own of some women .
women are portées particularly to institutional and well are contentes of traiter of sujets as which , where , with which , how and why .
perhaps that each of us laisse échapper a small step persiflage inoffensif here and there .
hand on the coeur c' is , however , a particularité of women .
but the pire are which actually conseillent , persiflent , even méprisent the other and are for their entourage - especially to the work in a collectif of women - particularly goods .

how have évolué the prices of voyages since 1989
jusqu'en 1989 there were in tchécoslovaquie only 5 agences of voyage d' state : cedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autotourist .
the agences of voyage to this époque proposaient of voyages especially in the countries of the bloc party , because the voyages to l' ouest depend very limités .
the touristes tchèques voyageaient for the festive in germany of l' is , soviétique union ( sotchi , crimée and sea spillage ), in bulgarie , roumanie ( the two at sea spillage ) and in hongrie ( balaton ).
a great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was autorisé of voyager in yougoslavie then the régime commença to be an inclination to l' ouest and voyages towards the yougoslavie furent very limités for the touristes tchèques .
the great paradoxe of l' époque party was qu' it nétait not autorisé for citizens of bloc party ( also for the tchécoslovaques ) of voyager individuellement even in the context of countries socialists .
in the case where the benefit tchécoslovaque voulait voyager individuellement example in pologne or in the union soviétique it considered him a letter d' invitation otherwise the voyage individuel n' was not autorisé .
the agences of voyage to this époque offraient also of voyages to l' ouest however it considered to be the queue any the dawn with a sac of couchage either be an " good familiar " within l' agence of voyage .
and even after this this n' was not yet gagné .
l' agree to the devises which was the condition for voyager to l' ouest was dragged to people " politiquement incorrects " which pouvaient not just the voyager .
the monnaie tchécoslovaque n' was not however échangeable and it n' was not possible d' misunderstandings levels financial without l' agree to devises ( monnaie occidentale ) for voyager to l' ouest .
the tchèques passaient the more often their festive in countries where there were therefore many maisons of areas and chalets that the tchèques s' achetaient and this habitude dure until now .
the voyages of tchèques have since connu since 1989 a great révolution .
that jusqu'en 1989 the festive in germany of l' is and bulgarie depend on maximum , the tchèques have past l' last year to l' abroad 4 million of jours of festive in the countries of the world entier .
the great paradoxe which we n' have not conscience today c' is that the countries most populaire is the croatie where n' was not possible d' goes librement jusqu'en 1989 because part of the yougoslavie of l' époque .
the suppression of visas in the years 90 of the last century in the countries of voisins l' ouest led to a énorme vague of visites of transition durée especially in austria to vienne and in germany .
the tchécoslovaques do not pouvaient during voyager long awaited by avion to l' ouest that each voulait improve at least a moment .
for example in paris the organisations of voyages faisaient dormir the tchèques in tentes in the parcs because our incomes do we not permettaient of payer l' hôtel or a pension .
the deal typique d' a voyage of tchèques was to this époque d' emporter with itself its own nourriture conserves , saucisson , etc. ... for économiser .
a moment other important was also l' interchangeabilité of the couronne tchèque which has enabled to our touristes finally after of dizaines d' years to be able to librement acheter of the monnaie occidentale .
our standards of living as well as the salaire way have increased which has led focused on l' year 1997 a time when other important .
through to a request croissante for the voyages the agences of voyages have commencé since 1997 to préparer of tours with of liaisons by charters aériens which are intended to contrats have formidablement réduit the costs to qu' there were before .
has the end of 90 years of the last century the tchèques had of liaisons without visas with practically the majority of countries développés of the world entier to hand the held which later have facilité our voyages .
a further when interesting in l' histoire tourism post-révolution when meticulous préparé the first charter air towards a exotique countries , the thaïlande , the federal tchèque .
since this year as each year charters aériens directs emmènent of touristes tchèques in the lointains countries chauds ; this hiver there will 12 destinations exotiques something the federal tchèque .
c' is more of 100000 tchèques which visitent the countries exotiques each year !
yet a time when interesting in this period which symbolise our development post-révolution is arrivé in 2008.
the 17 november 2008 the held have withdrawn the visas for the touristes tchèques and has enabled to our countries is ranger complètement in the group of countries développés .
in 2008 also the tchèques for the first time in histoire l' have enjoyed more of the of their festive to l' abroad ( 50 3% ) and for the first time in histoire l' still have dépensé more of 15 000 couronnes by someone for the festive to l' abroad , including the charges annexes . couronnes by someone .
l' house general must strike its president , but this military to take a close by a situation without solution " a pat "
closely of 5 m ois already the tchèque football is without president and it military that the successeur d' ivan hasek the top of l' association of football of the federal tchèque not be yet connu after still a house general which is dérouler thursday to nymburk .
however it n' current not d' agree according quel regulation of vote must be itself .
without this agree n' it is not possible to start to voting for l' one of the three acceding .
jindrich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomas paclik are intéressés by the directorate the football tchèque .
hasek has given its démission june and in its originally has man its members has s' unir and find a forte personnalité which dirigera the football in the forthcoming .
only during l' ère after hasek the football is revenu appropriate to use towards of divergences between the chambres of l' association which may not is set d' agree on a candidat up .
this s' is complètement shown the 16 september lorsqu'il considered choisir a new president .
the délégués of l' house general have declared réunis unnecessarily in the maison nationale to prague because the negotiation is upheld bloquée and it n' has not been question of traiter of the élire d' manner .
it n' there not held d' agree to know who has the law voting to l' house general - only , semble-t-il , the representatives statutaires or shall also the officials investis of pleins authorities .
in this unique point there has chipped agree part-time since this moment with l' aid also of the bureau for l' state and the law , according to which the représentation on the basis of the plein at n' is not possible .
the continuent divergences always in the regulation for l' elected .
it is clear that too exécutif committee , which in its negotiations planifiées or extraordinaires , n' has nothing made , not of the situation
the opinion on the possibilitě of vote have changé several times but the point névralgique demeure always the same .
the question is : how itself for the third turn for do not tomber in the pat .
" the pomme of discorde réside in fact line : be itself according to the statuts either strike a further model ", constatait l' one of the three vice-présidents of l' association of football of the federal tchèque dusan svoboda which represent the football professionnel within l' association .
according to the rules of the model exceptional gagne on third turn telecommunications acceding which will received the more votes in percentage within the chambre for which it is candidat .
the moravie is prepared according to what l' it said to take requesting that gagne the candidat which will received absolute percentage of votes of two chambres .
and the proposals tchèque étudie the condition that the vainqueur should be the two third at least of pourcentages of votes .
" only this ferait forget then l' idea of two tours précédents and this ferait refusing complètement the expression bicaméral ", admet svoboda which understands the objections of the proposals morave and according to which the it would be better not to changer the regulation and voting according to the statuts in force .
c' is surprenant that tomas paclik be also d' agree even s' it considers that the regulation taking drawn up according to the statuts competitive the more pelta among all the acceding .
" i wish that l' it vote on maximum according to the statuts of l' association ".
" for qu' it n' there has not yet d' produce saugrenues imaginées by a représentant as during the assemblées broad experience ", regard the owner of victoria plzen which is candidat for the first time and which in its exposés s' is défini especially against pelta .
pelta still optimiste .
according to him nymburk there will take a new president and croit that the acceding coopèreront in the forthcoming whole and constructive manner .
" the qualification possible today in championnat d' europe should calmer everyone ".
" the football will once again on a vague of bonheur and there aure more d' entrain for a cooperation " add l' officier of jablonec which among the three has the more experience as regards the directorate football as professionnel qu' on regional levels .
rajchl is more pessimiste .
" i think in this agree but unfortunately the situation is very tendue ".
this n' " is not a problem between the tchèques and moraves , but there of harmful to the rules changer tend to dessin ".
" this can boundless again a blocage to l' assemblé general ".
" j' hope all the same that saine reason gagnera " has said rajchl .
it does not still very much time for a common agree to all parties .
some réuunions should be place directly to the monténégro but which can say if any the directorate the football will complète for the match .
the changeover spécialement affrété in which devaient voyager until podgorice between other the vice-présidents dalibor kucera and rajchl , n' has not décollé for the reasons techniques and that cherchait a variante for emmener a part of the committee on the exécutif losing of représailles .
has the end c' is the meeting ministérielle , which may be voted on wednesday , which should be déterminante .
the secretary of éducation l' of the jeunesse and sports joseph dobes would be very heureux of recevoir the parties déchirées within l' association sportive the more forte the countries and bring about a agree .
in the jeu there very : a provision interventionism , the crédibilité the football and also l' house general l' union tchèque of sports which must regard the directorate the sport tchèque after the problems of financial sazka .
paclik s' in doubt to combat for the poste of president because it does voit air candidat correct .
if the leader of footballeurs of plzen tomas paclik had seen before l' house general which the profil might previously to everything qu' it request for a new president of l' association of football of the federal tchèque ( afrt ) it would not put in areas for this haute civil .
" if a follow-up candidat current i l' pro-active , i fight for him and i am not who is not to l' elected ."
" but in the current situation n' it has not been possible to strike a follow-up candidat ", has declared paclik to l' agence of press tchèque ( ctk ).
the motives of paclik is d' entrer in compétition with miroslav pelta and jindrich rajchl for precisely essayer empêcher pelta d' accéder to the top of afrt l' which to a priori would call favori for this elected .
paclik also drew qu' in the case where the remporterait taking it tiendrait this poste of president only jusqu'en 2013 year planned for a house general .
it verrait in the civil a manager expérimenté and safe but which n' is not linked with the world of football .
" j' i have discussed with people who really the profil ", dit-il .
" for call this has been terrible when some m' have said qu' they do not voulaient be identifiés with the tchèque football in this time ."
" j' aimerais do changer this image ", any deficiencies .
what , dit-on , gêne especially paclik , c' is the integration of pelta and the president of the regional l' union football of plzen roman berbr , homme to the renommée contreversée which is connu in the coulisses as lobbyiste able d' influer on the vote of délégués ' l' assemblé general .
for paclik it n' is not acceptable that pelta representing this position of president .
" s' it gagnait , state l' taught us demeurerait and it n' there might nothing again in the ." football
" and with l' frameworks of berbr , which is a commerçant of high changeover , this would still less support the ", football has declared paclik .
what the choque still c' is that the behalf of pelta has been acquitted there few years during d' écoutes in d' it on a money after of corruption , for which pelta s' is sorti without no ago .
" i do not know quel prestige pelta apporterait on football ."
and how serions-nous considérés to feel of l' uefa and the fifa said " paclik , which has declared there rather time " if pelta meaning president , i vends the club of plzen ".
in the case where paclik triompherait to the vote of thursday , it should prouver qu' it may coopérer with felta .
rajchl , a other candidat which had been appuyé by paclik before l' house general september who had terminé by a fiasco , believe doing just the same .
" it ( pelta ) it would be the first with which j' irais ".
" he has of great skills "
" it would be able , is present example as leader of the représentation ".
" but as manager of l' association it would not be able ."
" i do not mentioning the nez in this that i am not ", indicated in september paclik which has attiré a great attention when it s' is acquitted for l' annulation of the commission of arbitres with ludek macela qu' has remplacé dagmar damkova .
paclik affirme qu' it would at for diriger l' association .
it takes as example capacities to diriger of firmes privées and qu' it dirige also since l' last year the club of plzen which has fêté with his frameworks in may last his triomphe in first division .
" j' i have the power to do changer accomplished in the world of sport and for there to be some culture ".
" i freinerais l' influence of some groups intéressés which have example tendance to influer on the commission disciplinaire and d' appeal , which amène to situations of mauvais goût ", has deficiencies paclik which do not chache his antipathie for the leader of the sparta daniel kretinsky .
it also envisagerait harmonisation of institutional with the committee olympique tchèque which the order of lobby auprès policies safe possible d' get for the sport more money d' of l' tax on the jeux .
" c' is one of the key points which the new president should s' focus ".
" s' it s' is the kind on the jeux of coincidentally as the déclarent the partis policies , i comprends their argumentations but they should also say where going l' money ", any politicians .
paclik does not its current liaison with the club of plzen as accomplished of négatif even if itself affirme that the president of afrt l' should be " in - dessus of partis ".
pelta is again linked with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague .
this n' " is not l' idéal ".
i do not understand of activity convey my action of club of plzen to quelqu'un if i dois return a an and half after ", has declared paclik .
pelta has promis new statuts for l' afrt which should draw end to situations of pat .
two jours before l' house general l' association of football l' one of the candidat to the presidency miroslav pelta has promis that s' it is élu , l' afrt will take new statuts which should draw end in the forthcoming to querelles in the regulation for taking .
the official of jablonec is before the meeting of thursday to nymburk very optimiste and believe that the succés today the représentation of football should calmer this guéguerre before the vote .
pelta before l' elected of september which s' is not réalisée has promis precisely of is consacrer to the représentation nationale and l' obtention levels of financial s' it is élu .
it s' is décidé to be candidat to the latter when juste before l' house general passée and this delay of two months may enable him of défendre its vision of the directorate the football and of the present in a widest ways .
" people to all the average refuse the football been long awaited and attendent that thursday there a president ".
" they entrepreneurs that c' is the best when for quelqu'un takes the directorate l' association ", ajoute-t-il , but it is to linked with the club of jablonec , has a large number travaillé d' years on sparta and the committee exécutif of l' union .
c' is also for this qu' it quite possède d' expériences for diriger the football tchèque .
it is absolutely certain that derrière the problems actuels with l' elected is trouve a euphorie which régnait to lépoque d' ivan hasek .
" unfortunately to l " assemblé general june of statuts have been approuvés which n' not delivered parfaits as all s' are aperçus ".
" s' it n' there had not all these diverses interprétattions we already held a president since september ", out pelta .
c' is precisely the revision of the document the more important to l' association civique which has taken any l' attention of délégués .
" if i deviens president , i exciting as mission interpretation and am prêt to in resolve all responsibility in the case where this does not ". day
" c' is a principle without which we can not exister ", has deficiencies pelta .
then it s' efforce , dit-on , not to take confronter to its adversaires .
he has declared antérieurement qu' it can coopérer with jindrich rajchl qu' it reconnait held connection to its training in law and qu' it know pertinemment that his adversaire-candidat would his first vice-président .
it n' has not not attaqué been long awaited tonas paclik which the opposite n' not stop to criticise pelta .
" it decide in the football since a an and has already held a few succés ."
" its attaques n' depend however not of honorables and has surpris many people in the areas ."
" c' is also for this that some have now of doutes on his international ", has declared pelta to l' adresse of his adversaire but demeure , dit-il , fidèle to proclamations qu' he has made in september .
his arme the more forte is according to combat its familiar the football something of compétitions the more bas level until the réprésentation nationale .
this should be a vitirne the football .
and i m' efforcerais also to close all affaires which commencent with exercises bohémians or the light of the scandale of corruption ."
" j' entrerais immédiatement in negotiations with the public and private sector that we get get quite d' money for all the ", football has declared to agence l' of press tchèque ctk the 46 è me candidat there has two months .
it has also deficiencies that its nomination to the top of the n' football encourage air change to people .
" i do devrais familiar with all the employés ", any politicians to strahov where règne a compréhensible nervosité since qu' it n' there no directorate .
although qu' there scénarii catastrophiques scheduled with l' house general , it think that the délégués n' iront not to nymburk for nothing .
" s' there is a only point of discorde on the way of the third we arriverons turn to the surpasser ".
" the football needs crédibilité and it l' obtiendra that there will lorsqu'il to its top a new leader ", as the declare resumed manner optimiste pelta two jours before the journée probability déterminante for its carrière of official .
rajchl promet that under its directorate l' afrt commencerait to working dur
" if the vice-président taught us jindrich rajchl is élu again president of l' association of football of the federal tchèque to l " house general thursday this does not plairait to large number of people , parait-il .
rajchl promet but in the case where it would élu it commencera to working dur .
it wishes of changes systémiques and make the states of the exécutif committee are responsible of various fields of football .
it has also promis of régler l' money after bohémians , improving the institutional with l' uefa and the fifa , making the football more d' money and allow the work commencé by the predecessor ivan hasek .
" as president i wish m' focus the football in his entier ".
" of internationaux contacts with l' uefa and the fifa on travers of the représentation nationale , football professionnel and d' a football performant for the jeunesse ."
" but i do raising not that i shall do all this only " has said rajchl in a entretien for ctk .
" i am a joueur d' équipe and wish distribuer the powers within the committee exécutif so that each states s' representing d' an area déterminé ."
and i distribuerai of missions hard for the football such a large not before ".
" very people do not be contents because it s' agira of start to working dur rather than that of criticising the other " any deficiencies .
it has done state , dit-on , qu' it does not représenterait as candidat , given d' a atmosphère critique .
" has of thinking , we all know that i works 20 by off ." p.m.
" but j' i need of whether this nonetheless worth the coup and if j' aurai people derrière call which mettront without much-trumpeted of bâtons in the roues and émettront of doutes on each of my action ", expliquant why it hésitait .
" a lot of people m' have any equally said that i do not dois renoncer because they renonceraient also ".
" cest a confidence that i could not trahir ", dit-il .
what the motive , dit-on , is also of allow the work commencé with hasek .
" since last these two years there has chipped great work of done and i do not want the laisser tomber ".
" there has process which have been lancés which auront of consequences in a few years and i n' aimerais not that quelqu'un the stop .', any politicians with the crainte that in the case of l' elected of miroslav pelta the situation within the union revienne l' as it was before hasek .
" i think to a survey work and c' is a time that mirek pelta do know not do ".
" derrière him is finding of people who fairaient the football in such a way qu' it would only to those which have been choisis ".
" i can be accused a number of something but sûrement no loaded onto quelq'un ".
" i m' efforce d' be objective ".
" i wish to ensure football for all because everyone in content will not only those which have been choisis
and it confirme again qu' it would only a president for the tchéquie .
" and s' there , which disent the opposite , i am prêt to do the maximum for the moravie ".
for example , c' " is the time d' envisager that the second division be divisée in two parties l' a tchèque and l' other morave whose vainqueurs is retrouveraient in first division ."
" it n' there might not of situation as currently with only three équipe moraves in the division because the problem is currently to young people joueurs .
as paclik tomas , president of club of plzen , is entré in the compétition for the poste of president , rajchl can assessing its own opportunities of gagner .
" i sense in permanence a supporting the chambre tchèque which m' has élu his vice - president and know qu' with call there will of succés ", has rajchl politicians who envisage among its futurs succés d' économiser of dizaines of million of couronnes on of contrats désavantageux , negotiations of contrats with the télévisions and on the loi on the jeux .
it said that the opposite that l' association not be unie is a apart common to all .
considering qu' it said in the matter of pelta " qu' it is disqualifié because with him the footblal tchèque perdrait its crédibilité ", it think that the second adversaire paclik is a strong candidat which has from offer the football .
" someone can provide in doubt to plzen qu' he has done this year a superbe work ".
" s' it was élu it continuerait sûrement in which has been commencé by hasek and do not ferait of change notable among the people in the ." ensures
" it does not voudrait is gâcher its succés " has said rajchl which has évaluait its rivaux .
the most belles piscines of l' europe
a saut in the bleu
of julia stanek
pataugeoires in viewpoint d' ovni , piscines magnifiques of budapest : which voyage to travers l' europe can vivre his miracle bleu - and following tourné towns or done a youth promenade can laisser reposer its jambes fatiguées in bains d' water gazeuse .
a white signs in quel bassin of natation can experience the more of welfare .
when iris meder allait in voyage research during the latest 18 months , there is a decide which should not manquer in its bagages : his maillot of bain .
étendu on his expense in l' water , it observa the coupoles artistiquement arrangées , and nageait to l' uk of marbres putten which l' expected of l' other say the piscine and do manquait d' admirer l' art again méticuleusement restauré of these piscines converties .
if a piscine couverte him faisait plaisir , it notait in his carnet without period all the details concerning dignes d' interest on the type of construction and on l' histoire the building .
more 200 piscines have been sondées of this manner by l' historienne d' architecture meder and it have presented in its white already submitted : " badefreuden ( joies the bain ". the piscines covered municipales of münich , the palais of bain historiques in the forêt spillage " brussels of béton hardcore " in the taunus .
she has conduit its " voyages to bains the most exceptionnels of l' central europe " in 13 countries . to say l' l' germany , austria and the suisse , it has visité respectivement of lieux italy , france , tchéquie , the slovaquie , slovénie , hongrie , roumanie , pologne and towns in luxembourg , serbie and croatie .
allemande l' of 46 years is a true fervente the culture of bain .
meder , explique qu' it n' has not very d' interest for the sport but ell is sent to attiré l' water d' a totally different manner .
c' is irritant that the supporteurs of the natation must take content ourselves with contempler of carreaux bleus and s' live with the puanteur of water l' of javel tandis that the joggers respirent the parfum envoûtant of forêts d' épicéa or may listening to the gazouillement d' oiseaux joyeux the parc .
" i am demandée a off why the piscines must , in fact be always if laides said " the viennoise .
" i commençais a collection of beaux bains ."
the surface of water l' further doublement l' architecture
a plongée in a piscine and huiles of sauna volatiles - facteur of welfare in the salles of natation are facing because all the sense are éveillés , d' after meder .
and if the bâtisseurs is seraient donnés a little more ago , the salles to nager pourraient be a true délice for feel : " the place d' a plancher it has a surface water d' in the salles of natation ."
" it is d' say a transparent , but reflect d' a other say however the beauté the building all entier ."
all the surfaces is totally disregards optiquement d' a manner double : of voûtes hautes , carreaux multicolores , tremplins .
the volume d' image of small step format " badefreuden " done a report digne d' of 190 pages on l' histoire d' architecture and culture on l' oasis the welfare historical - it gives certainly envie to a saut in the bleu .
the collectionneuse meder has découvert of exemplaires remarquables durant its recherches in hongrie .
to say of bains of welfare splendides as the bain széchenyi âgé of 100 years budapest , it was of eaux contenant the nitrate in a caverne naturelle in the karst ( bain of caverne in miskolc-tapolca ) well qu' a bain of thermes whose bassins are remplis d' water contenant of l' alcali and ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény ) and is trouvant in a building in forme of bouteille .
by against the piscines chauffées in plein test of the suisse and austria supply of vues spectaculaires . tandis that d' a toit the bain of zürich it has any towns to its feel , one can admirer l' arlberg enneigé something d' a piscine extérieure of st . anton : the bain turcs is muni d' a fenêtre something which can observer l' community action groups on the piste of ski .
perhaps the attitude of piscine the more extraordinaire attend the nageurs in längenfeld : l' aqua dome ötztal ressemble to a ovni which d' atterrir on the alpes .
in hiver , the vapeur s' élève of three plateaux ouverts , tandis in l' arrière-plan s' élèvent the montagnes of l' ötztal towards the ciel .
alhambra in the forêt spillage
l' smell of water l' of javel n' émane not all piscines the collection meder .
many bains thermiques émanent a smell of soufre , l' árpád-spa in the bekescsaba hongrois émane a forte smell of pétrole , qu' it is difficult to think , is strike in a spa health .
provient l' smell of eaux alcalines thérapeutiques contenant of l' hydrogène of carbone which is almost noir and his limon you colle to the peau therefore that you laissez glisser in the piscine - a experience of spa spéciale .
durant its quête of belle piscines , iris meder has also subi of déceptions : when it voulait visiter bad luhatschowitz , a piscine extérieure gratuite and in plein test of the tchécoslovaquie , it s' is trouvée face a losing barricadé .
the conçu bain by l' architèque dušan jurkovic in 1902 meticulous entre-temps fermé .
in jetant a coup d' œil by the fenêtre of l' immeuble-art again in rouge-blanc-jaune , it has observé l' épanouissement of mauvaises herbes between the carreaux .
it has observé a word opposite in a charmante piscine in the forêt spillage : the palais of thermes of bad wildbad .
this building has already survécu three phases ; one can découvrir not only of néo-romains elements which sortent since its attitude in 1844 but still a salle maure in style alhambra which him has been deficiencies in 1900.
since its modernisation soigneuse of 1995 the palais thermal demeure the bain favori of l' experte in piscine , iris meder - and not just because qu' it is originaire of schwarzwald .
" c' is already a beau return that of of fondre styles of construction if different in a unité if backward ", said meder .
with a follow-up palais , the plongée in the piscine thermale is apparently only a question mineure .

è 21 i maison to vienne
the pavillon which has déménagé
ingeborg d' wiensowski
a histoire d' architecture with of hauts , bas and a happy end : the pavillon austrian for the expositions mondiales of strasbourg in 1958 has remporté of prices , has been a musée to vienne , is resté vide then is tombé in ruine .
now it is again open and impression place of maison d' exposition .
if we s' l' enthousiasme for a architecture d' après-guerre moderne , for its formes quite clear , its hangars in verre , its allures vives and audacieuses and its new matériaux of construction which are typiques of the croyance envers technical progress , considering the pavillon of l' architecte austrian karl schwanzer for l' exposition universelle of strasbourg in 1958 in is a good and célèbre example .
the pavillon of schwanzer reçut autrefois the " large prices d' architecture " for its construction in industry and in verre , légère and suspendue .
the construction is considérée until our jours as an important étape in l' architecture contemporaine .
it has rendu the architectes if célèbres , qu' it has also construit the pavillon for l' exposition universelle autrichienne achieving .
with its légendaire maison to four cylindres of bmw and its construction adjacente in forme of bol to munich , it is surely grew célèbre at nature in 1973.
his draft pavillon as construction interim had been after l' exposé exposition universelle in the jardin suisse to the gare the south of vienne , has been transformé and , in 1962 a musée the 20 è me century has open -
but the building n' was reliable physiquement reliable techniquement adapté for a musée - not to murs for accrocher the œuvres d' art , therefore not a right environment .
however it was indeed utilisé , solved " to what l' art contemporain reçoive a new édifice to vienne .
since 2001 the building was vide and s' is more and more délabré .
now l' architecte adolf krischanitz has transformé the pavillon , something now the behalf of " maison the 21 è me century " and will to l' future utilisé as musée for l' art contemporain .
tuesday night the musée belvédère has open , something the maison up , the first exposition - a coup of chance to all point of view .
the new originally has been mené to by agnès husslein-arco , which is devenue the new directrice in 2007 of the galerie autrichienne belvédère .
husslein-arco , has promu a historienne d' art to carrière effort between other in its jeunesse of patineuse artistique , by the light here sotheby's , on musée guggenheim and as directrice fondatrice the musée of l' art moderne of salzbourg , it has mené particularly to the work of auprès transformation of men policies and protection of monuments , she has approved of public and private sponsoring and in has stated l' exploitation .
excepté l' art contemporain , the œuvres the sculpteur fritz wotruba which the fondation something the same behalf there have been exposées , a café and a librairie s' finding there , and a bureau must there be construit .
stricte surveillance , small step budget
for the implementation krischanitz was therefore l' interprète idéal .
not only because qu' it had transformé and élargi with sensibilité the sécession of joseph olbracht and qu' it had gagné the concours , but because qu' it had close to l' université technical nature of vienne and that for combat the pavillon was " a place extremely important " place where it had seen " practically each week-end " the expositions .
it connaissait the draft d' districts , and it connaissait the problems of l' édifice , which perdit in générosité and légèreté light to his déplacement to vienne and by his change d' use .
in the transformations drawn , there eut of worst problems : l " édifice was " a gouffre in energy ", said krischanitz .
the profils of fenêtres of façades in verre furent changés , the verre isolant renforcé in fibres of verre meticulous posé and the toit remplacé by a verre of safety particular .
the poutrelles of ponts thermiques have been renforcées or remplacées , and the revêtements remplis d' amiante have been réhabilités .
two sous-sols have done the place to the new exploitation , a panneau of light tamisé between the maison and the road assure l' éclairage , a pont conduit to l' entry - c' is almost a new construction , but always the léger pavillon schwanzer .
the portes extérieures d' origines are restées , the maison is peinte in a teinte protection against the rouille of couleur rouge-brun .
and the salle of cinéma is even exactement identique to this qu' it was autrefois .
and this under étroite surveillance authorities of compétentes for monuments and with a small step budget .
" often of matériaux which are many and ladies devaient be trouvés , and which plaisent also to l' monopolies protection monuments ", said krischanitz and it l' draw attention to a sol inhabitant in sous-sol .
despite all the contraintes , the problems and transformations , l " édifice is resté souple and léger .
this might have been difficult with the pavillon , " which provenait of strasbourg ", has said krischanitz much , a histoire typique of " drop-in-the-city ".
such a architecture trouve " is still on mauvais place " and wishes despite everything " éveiller good conscience ".
but in this case the maison the 21 è me century does not trouve on mauvais place , because s' it s' is a coup d' of chance of urban construction : focused the jardin suisse is dresse precisely the " quartier of the central gare " all nouvellement exceptional , with bureaux and appartements .
and a other coup of chance going perhaps is produire : the maison the 21 è me century may bénéficier the renfort d' another construction krischanitz , because the collectionneuse francesca von habsburg has acheté the relations d' art interim berlinois , and as it is said , it négocie already with the towns so d' get a site in the voisinage the jardin suisse .

hiver l' final the society of chemins of iron has chipped much of problems for the transport d " usagers , because it qu' lack of other reservation in case of conditions météorologiques hard .

it s' is the vente of documents d' hypothèque .
the régulateur of financial markets ncua something to great banks a great deal d' accusations , and this d' be inciter banks coopératives to do to fausses promesses on l' achat of financial products ; they really minimisé the risks .
these documents have perdu much of value in the financial crise and have entraîné banks towards the bas .

jusque-là the worst investisseur américain warren buffett explique without much-trumpeted do not investir in companies informatiques ti , looking that l " development in long term of societies do laissent apparaître that of mauvais pronostics .
it has lu but the reports d' ibm and has changé his opinion on the invest in this sector .
it had already of the comprendre very much more tôt qu' ibm proposes , especially of prestations services and systems informatiques for the sectors ti d' other companies .
a direct of warren buffett is considered to be a attaque of chevalier in the world of the finance .
therefore l' activity ti ibm s' octroie the law of s' appeler now " mr ibm ".
because buffett has shown today to l " émission economic cnbc , qu' it has acheté since march of action ibm d' a value of 10,7 billion of dollars .

the fondateur bill gates would a right ami .
the menace is palpable
after the découverte of the " cellule of zwickauer " the médias turcs doutent of l' state of german law .
a newspaper speak even d' a " idéologie sanglante ", which renaîtrait now .
the assassinats of huit ressortissants turcs and d' a small business grecque in the years 2000 to 2000-2006 had a extrémiste ways .
light to this new , the turquie that the population germano-turque réagit with peur and inquiétude .
because for many of germano-turcs the spectre that l' it croyait execution since long awaited refait his apparition : since the incendiaires bomb of mölln in november solingen in may 1992 and 1993 it n' there more held of violence comparable with this extrémiste ways of droite against the turcs .
qu' there in germany a xénophobie , it n' in has never been however question .
the net extrémiste of droite which has been détecté révèle but of proportions which the aspect is loin d' be prévisible .
" est-ce a retour to l' idéologie sanglante ", " employ was the under the parution on the internet quotidien turc " haberturk ".
the newspaper " sabah " out to materialise that l' one of the auteurs might have been a v-homme protection of the constitution , and s' inquiète the fact that the authorities allemandes pourraient be impliquées in the bourbier d' extrême-droite .
c' is in raisonnée qu' responded the community turque in germany : it has man this week-end to commémoration silencieuse to victims of violence raciale towards something of brandebourg .
this n' is that two weeks auparavant that the community turque berlin and the policies allemands and turcs had pensé to cérémonie the cinquantième anniversaire of l' agree to recrutement germano-turc .
c' is with the couleurs gaies that the cohabitation had been implementation of scène , symbolisant a histoire of réussite .
the reports of some médias turcs refuse l' down d' a gifle : " the cadeau of l' germany for the cinquantième anniversaire " employ is the under d' a article in the plateforme turque " haber x ", which réfère on ways of the great deal of meurtres .
also the parution allemande of the " hürriyet " do not prive d' in might conditions univoques .
" ça commence to puer ", employ is the under the chronique d' ahmet külahci .
there out that people really been assassinés , really payé of exemptions and really made by their work a contribution important to rebuild of l' germany .
l' action of the police has been perçue way very critique on the germano-turcs forums and our citizens had by light debated the success of their recherches .
why it n' is not already come a lot more tôt to l' spirit of allemandes authorities to of recherches in some bodies suspects d' particular droite , s' étonnent the auteurs .
more d' a is signs prêt at least to levels rhétoriques thus drastiques : " if money after l' further education to be bâclée , it does restera to migrants nothing d' other that l' autodéfense and l' armement ".
" ça will the better auto-défense ".
" the paix intérieure in germany dépend encouraging the quality of l' information and the pertinence of the punition of l' whole net ", wrote " selen ".
what this means that if the paix intérieure in germany is in danger , the bomb of mölln and solingen in the years 90 have very expliqué .
the photo of ruines after l' instructions to solingen is well anchored in the mémoire allemande and turque .
because air other événement n' has shown more clearly to turcs vivant here qu' there a menace tangible , and to allemands , on from the méfiance and the distance by practice of violence pouvaient déboucher .
the bomb have but aiguisé the opinion of we in the community turque .
never not repeat the erreurs past
autrefois c' is especially l' failure of the policy allemande after the bomb which the press turque s' is plainte : helmut kohl has dragged of make visite to survivants of mölln .
after l' instructions to solingen it has envoyé a télégramme of condoléances on leader l' state turc , s' is done représenter to funérailles to cologne by his secretary of affaires étrangères klaus kinkel - kinkel comptait to l' époque in his speech , combien of able produisait the population turque base .
as if the value d' a homme could be évaluée on the level of its fiscales charges .
l' taught us report of médias turcs signs once more combien the méfiance of many of germano-turcs is profonde envers l " state of law operators since this date .
furthermore the efforts d' a more ample éclaircissement and réévaluation the terrorisme d' extrême-droite in germany , a clear message is this fois-ci necessary .
the banque to scandale the lac of zürich
the banque the more aventureuse d' europe does not trouve italy or in france , but in suisse .
ubs l' has done almost faillite in the financial crise and patine entre-temps d' a crise to l' other .
c' is a german which must diriger now .
this n' is certainly not this qu' axel weber s " was imaginé .
after its starting spectaculaire the top of the bundesbank ; it has seen in july , qu' it occuperait in 2013 a poste almost also spectaculaire : president of council d' administration of the great banque suisse ubs - a great towards carrière inattendue and lucrative .
axel weber s' is publiquement delight , has salué ; the suisse for its beauté and l' ubs for its solidité much achieved and has done passer d' aimables comments on the futurs members .
" l' ubs has réussi the turnaround ".
" i am pleased the cooperation with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel ".
however , and therefore the months of september it was clear that allait changer .
a marchand of titres d' ubs to londres had détourné all the systems of safety of the banque and had flambé environ 1,7 d' billion .
the leader of the council d' administration of l' ubs oswald grübel , a banquier very connu not only in suisse , , something .
the president of the council d' administration of l' ubs is considered since as souffrant - and all fundamentally : when axel weber revient-il finally ?
we have already appris that weber can be conseillé of the banque something february 2012.
and it reprendra the presidency d' administration already in may - not by 2013 as l' has communiqué the banque tuesday .
for axel weber this difficult meaning .
it n' is not banquier , very much more professeur d " economy and president of the banque , and it might certainly held need d' period d' adaptation .
a coup d' only it assume considering the responsibility for the strategy d' a banque , which of prouver once more and more qu' she has been long awaited served the under of " the more banque to scandale d' europe ".
it is ubs l' d' a say énorme - until much , it was the more worst gestionnaire d' actifs of the world , and of l' other , it patine since of years d' a scandale to l' other .
nothing , semble-t-il , n' bank the if fière banque suisse .
this has commencé during the financial crise .
jusqu'en 2007 l' ubs had a réputation begin .
l' image of the gestionnaire suisse d' actifs , silencieux and sound , but also rusé , l' had combiné with objectives ambitieux : it voulait also believe , in the field of l' direct bancaire , a very great banque .
therefore ubs l' gérait d' a say in 2007 with 1,6 billion of dollars more money d' incorporate d' a customers aisée that any other banque in the world .
d' secondly , she had advanced as banque d' direct in the ligue of great banks of the world .
this has done impression .
ancien l' banquier hans geiger and later professeur of banque during of longues years to zurich raconte : " j' i have always taken l' ubs as model of banque face my étudiants ."
" in l' viewpoint stand , it is request : how est-ce that j' set just been answered my indicator to this point ?"
it s' is well trompé .
in 2007 it is apparu that for the first time accomplished do not tournait rond to l' ubs .
the areas of l' year president peter wuffli s' is withdrawn way surprenante , which was considered jusque-là as a high intellectuel well qu' a banquier génial .
a few months later was pressenti for taking reasons it was party .
the division of the banque had flambé with the documents sub-prime and has the do a croix on of billion .
for this épauler , l' ubs has expected an increasing d' capital totalling 13 billion of francs and has done a croix dessus .
for this it has actually thought of investor , but which , little time before , really froncé the sourcils : a form d' state asiatique non-transparent incorporate of singapour and a form d' state arabe , which meticulous past under silence , the point that l' it n' even never appris his behalf .
this n " was however that the first coup .
in avril 2008 this s' is empiré .
the banque adhere annoncer of once again pertes is chiffrant to billion , president of the council marcel ospel d' administration , which was still in 2000-2006 the second council d' administration the better payé of suisse , will retira .
in october 2008 the disaster suivit : l' ubs is was , due to its erreurs d' direct , in the financial crise before the faillite and dut be sauvée by l' state .
the banque nationale has racheté to l' ubs of dizaines of billion of titres problématiques , the confédération suisse has given six billion of francs for the regulatory convertibles in action , why it could believe copropriétaire of the banque .
the whole of the suisse has been secouée - because she has taken note to quel point this can be terrible for a small step countries , d' abriter of if great banks .
finally , the total of the bilan of l' ubs 2007 s " éleva to be more five times the economic performance of the suisse ( improve graphique ).
" we n' have not been save l' ubs once more ", said the chercheur of banks , geiger .
after the first disaster it s' is followed the second .
already few months before , l' ubs had capitulé to commend d' a différend fiscal with l' america and s' is declared prepared to publier the data of the aisée customers , who had fraudé the fisc perhaps with l' aid of the banque .
furthermore , it has accepté a paiement of 780 million of dollars - in back to bénéfices injustifiés incorporate these opérations with a amende majorée .
well ubs l' has more or less submitted qu' it had aidé to the fraude competition-friendly taxation .
at the same time , it has perdu accomplished which has always been his capital in competition with the rich clients : the prestige of the discrétion .
after the scandale the secret bancaire suisse more n' has been the same .
it s' in suivit the retrait the leader of the council d' administration and the president of the council d' administration .
and l' exodus of l' money of clients .
well the banque had perdu in a few months crédibilité its in the two sectors d' money after principaux : l' direct bancaire to commend of mauvaises spéculations and the management d' actifs to commend of l' aid to the fraude competition-friendly taxation .
and , as there eut rather a retour on calme , and as it the pensait , that ubs l' s' in sortirait , it s' in suivit of this unfortunate histoire of marchands of under : a only marchand of under flambe 1,7 billion d' eur before that the banque do s' aperçoive that will not tournait not rond .
and it publie l' : with the management of risks in banque d' direct this does not function .
" with the case adoboli , it has seen that the maîtrise of risks to too little changé ", said martin janssen , économiste and professeur of finances to l' institut bancaire of l' université of zurich .
also directeur tunnel d' a great banque allemande is of course : " the problem of l' ubs is qu' it n' has not the maîtrise of risks in hand ."
however , it s' agissait exactement of l' idea of prudence , with which the banquiers suisses had been long awaited taken their civil , believe gardien of the great fortune of the world : no too major risks , but for safety l' money - and everyone could well s' effondrer on - delà of the federal alpine .
the trésors of banks suisses depend devenus the symbole d' a reliability inébranlable as lindt and sprüngli are for a chocolat particularly noble .
the central of l' ubs to zurich going even together with the sound cliché of the banque suisse private - it n' is qu' a little more .
already the situation is classique .
the banque has its siège to the gare central of zurich , which conduit directly to the gare central to the lac of zurich , which itself is entouré by the sommets enneigés of montagnes suisses .
the brussels are here prestigieux , the loyers of magasins figurent among the most high d' europe .
the bijoutiers as tiffany's , it the trouve here between the magasins of traditions suisses all as those of the confiserie sprüngli .
since the siècles of banquiers suisses have résidé here : the banque nationale in passant by the palais the crédit suisse until the banks privées élitistes as julius bär .
it arrive in the hall d' entry of l' ubs by a lourde something .
to internal l' , the murs are revêtus of marbre , faced is finding d' épaisses chaises of cuir , and to say the logo of the banque , a great étiquette for ". safe "
ubs l' know what the customer research here : the safety .
this idea of the banque suisse has a off or l' other écarté of the market - or trahi the two great suisses banks , l' ubs and the crédit suisse , as the leader d' a small banque private suisse trouve .
it préfèrerait do not reading his behalf in the newspaper , finally as all the banquiers suisses he of affaires also with the two great banks .
ubs l' would devenue too great , trouve-t'il - especially in l' direct bancaire , where the anglo-saxons is seraient furthermore répandus .
the suisses n' really there is nothing more to say .
and when very same , they have declared been long awaited adaptés to mœurs of anglo-saxons ."
this has been adopted the banque d' direct anglo-saxonne which has changé l' ubs , she has done of bénéfices high and then the débâcle : air establishment tunnel european n' has perdu world d' money in the jungle of sub-prime as great banque suisse .
the disaster is devenue apparente the 15 october 2008.
" this wednesday the coalition gouvernementale the small step countries to seven million d' habitants has entrepris the more opération of save in l' histoire of their nation ", wrote l' author lukas hässig in his white " the crash of l' ubs ".
with little 68 billion of francs environ , be 45 billion d' eur men policies have accepté of save the faillite great banque .
how this pouvait-il achieve ?
if l' we speak with of banquiers suisses , they looking to the problem especially to the scale of ubs l' .
in june 1998 two of three great banks suisses have conclu whole a énorme group .
a banque has been créée , which was already too great for the small suisse - and has enregistré without much-trumpeted a increasing .
this has aidé , c' is that the two banks prédécesseuses various of l' ubs have complété : a banque riche , but in léthargie with as point clear the management d' actifs to zurich and a more pauvre , but though already more encouraging internationalisé .
just coup , banks d' direct internationales have held favorablement access to many d' money , with which they have been tourner a énorme roue .
two noms are associés to l' ascension of ubs : peter wuffli , 2001 to 2007 leader of the group ubs , and marcel ospel , president of the council autrefois d' administration .
" j' i have always pensé that wuffli and ospel constituaient a équipe of rêve ", said the chercheur of banks , hans geiger .
" wuffli , the great intellectuel modest , which s' there hears very in macroeconomic and statistics , and ospel , l' intuitif , which s' is frayé a chemin jusqu'au supported with l' apprentissage of the banque ."
but ospel is would fié solved " to the end to wuffli .
and wuffli might probability commis to the end a mistake décisive : " it pensait that its macroeconomic depend the fact ", said geiger .
" c' is a chute tragique ."
tragique , perhaps .
one thing is clear : exubérance l' is arrivée before the chute .
known of l' ubs is souvient clearly of meetings of leaders in desquels the leader of the group wuffli has acquitted always the same mot d' agenda : détrôner goldman sachs .
the banque army was the banque d' direct the more puissante of the planète .
it has commandé the " league tables " the classements , which have documenté to this époque the success of banks .
after all ubs l' voulait monter do high .
some étapes him have already réussi .
in money after of devises and transactions of valeurs mobilières she has played a very important role .
advisers d' business , which have held the responsibility , have pointed out however a faiblesse : in the opérations internationales d' interests in the jargon bancaire " fixed income ", there might a énorme différence by report to more great banks .
ubs l' might of lacunes in terms of products d' hypothèques américains .
for this lacune sealing , l' ubs s' is lançait in a aventure him , which has almost coûté life .
assoiffés of growth , c' is also the banque proceed qu' a form of management créé before it in the placements sub-prime américains which have investi .
it s' is transformée in a massive machine which has emballé and done passer the documents of small-scale revenue-based value on the prepared hypothécaires américains - but which has also conservé of risks .
even when d' other banks cherchaient been long awaited to descendre .
" still in during l' been 2007 considering that the market of l' immobilier américain was in flammes , l' ubs has acheté where ", said geiger , l' expert bancaire .
more l' euphorie is great more the chute is brutale .
a manager l' after another , something , when a term to tentatives s' more difficult that l' it pensait .
of ubs creation here are devenus éjectables and are far bancaux .
as dirige great depth banque has a quasi impossible .
we must strike a strategy for a banque , for which all the macroeconomic d' business suggérés have disparu .
the chercheur of banque , geiger has already a idea : a term to the banque d' direct , concentration in the management of biens , retour to racines suisses .
but the banque no not ( still ) goes also loin .
but the banque d' direct must s' atrophier vigoureusement , world that this is clear solved " now .
thursday the leader banque sergio ermotti wishes present in the world its managed strategy .
italo-suisse l' âgé of 51 years was only supposé be to under short when the banque s' is séparée with surprise of his predecessor grübel .
entre-temps , it s' is imposé : it must durablement pursuing the affaires of l' ubs , has communiqué tuesday the banque of zurich .
ermotti wishes ramener the banque d' direct to state l' d' avancement the areas of years 1990.
it annule 3500 jobs .
but ça do not suffira .
ubs l' needs d' a vision .
which est-elle ?
with from veut-elle gagner of l' money ?
these are the questions qu " axel weber s' is certainly already posées .
it said publiquement until now only qu' it allait seek with its femme a appartement to zurich .
l' coming year .

the corneilles intelligentes is propagent in cities
in many d' endroits , freux are considérés as " d' problem oiseaux °" but the experts affirment that these animaux very intelligents does laissent more chasser of cities been long awaited .
some of the aiment , some other veulent s' in dispose d' also assume quickly as possible . corneilles the appartiennent to towns since of siècles , but in many communautés the plaintes of résidents is multiplient to commend the saleté and bruit of animaux .
a antidote against the "° problem d' oiseaux " n' is not yet with .
in the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corneilles , the experts have said that this n' is more possible chasser the freux of cities alone .
the experts of any l' germany has délibéré on the possible solutions .
they cherchent of alternatives in cities
the protecteurs the safer basaient the problems of cities also on l' exodus of freux particularly protégés : l' use of products chimiques in l' agriculture détruise more and more the espaces vitaux traditionnels .
the chasse , l' aménagement and l' abattage d' arbres of couvaison typiques rendaient life difficult to oiseaux .
the corneilles are under the protect the safer .
there of great colonies with more 600 couples of couvaison in the westfälischen soest , in the nord-ouest among which jever , diepholz and achim closely of bremen as well as in leer .
in 2005 a draft controversial had gagné of publicités négatives to commend the massacre of corneilles in this area .
the criticisms have thought the capture of oiseaux in pièges and their tuerie with of gourdins particularly brutal .
" l' expulsion normale , l' évincement , sert to nothing ", has seen the planificateur of towns and paysage of leer , werner klöver .
the destruction of nids to l' aid of water l' under pushes either abattre the arbres , often product of the consequences indésirables , has said l' expert d' environment manfred kaiser of lahr on bade-wurtemberg .
" the animaux s' éloignent , the great colonies is divisent and they will dispersent in d' other endroits ."
l " évincement n' is imaginable that in the case exceptionnels as in the hôpitaux , the maisons of retraite or écoles .
" we have to vivre with them , we can more the exterminer ."
the problem does not laisse solving in cities without l' proposed the remote , d' after l' opinion of the maire wolfgang kellner of leer .
concevable is a combinaison of l' évincement of animaux to a conditionnement aversif and offres accrocheuses , so of the enable of is réinstaller indeed .
psychologue and ethnologue , uta maria jürgens prospectait " of panneaux d' info to the place of tronçonneuses " so d' achieving institutional complètement various with the : " we can finally better loaded onto a bouton on the visage with a dose of confidence in itself ."
jürgens has co-fondé l' ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif of corbeilles on schleswig-holstein , panneaux routiers informant on the life of these freux very intelligents .
this project has been entre-temps adopted by the touristes .
jürgen has given its own opinion on the critique to l' connection of the bruit causé by the oiseaux : " so much a large number of communication , these oiseaux-là have much to say is ".
l' intelligence and l' habileté of animaux are légendaires : the freux n' utilisent not only of instruments of work to achieve a régal but they fabriquent themselves their essential tools as instruments of work .
of éthologistes of l' université of cambridge testaient four freux much , to quel point arrive l' intelligence of oiseaux .
in a experience , the oiseaux apprenaient quickly qu' they devaient do écrouler a échafaudage with of pierres for achieving well to larve .
without very d' entraînement , they reconnaissaient déterminément qu' a pierre adhere be some grosseur and forme to ensure effondrer the plate-forme .
in a second essai , the corneilles sensible devaient then solving a problem more trapu .
in a cylindre placé verticalement , the chercheurs had placé a small step seau with a larve .
the oiseaux do pouvaient not achieved their butin with their bec .
however , chercheurs had put of morceaux of fil of iron prior to their .

abattage l' of masse known
the new white of peter englund supply in-depth evaluation and générosité . intitulé " the beauty and the sorrow : an intimate history of the first world war " ( the beauté and the chagrin : a histoire intime of the first guerre mondiale ), it débute by a youth liste of personnages which you serre the cœur .
a council to start : déchirez carefully this page and faites-en your marque-page .
you apprendrez to finding these people details . in this récit romanesque of peter englund , this liste of personnages will your gps , a balise during these few moments where , as l' one of its men or women , you serez troublé and désespéré in the brumes of the guerre .
englund peter is a historien and journaliste suédois .
it is also the new secrétaire ongoing parliamentary discussion of l' académie suédoise , which délivre the prices of littérature nobel .
he has wrote here is a white hors of the common qu' it décrit , with exactitude , as a ouvrage " d' anti-histoire ."
it comporte few noms connus , of the treaties important or batailles célèbres ; it trouve presqu'aucun ambassadeur reliable consideration of the strategies and the matériel .
this n' is not as a white on this qu' it s' is past , explique-t-il , qu' a " white décrivant drove this could ressembler ". it retrouve the " sentiments , impressions , expériences and humeurs ."
" the beauté and the chagrin " résume the in time of guerre of 20 men and women or more or less ordinaires , two côtés of the guerre , young people écolières and botanistes to escaladeurs , passant by médecins , ambulanciers and vendeurs .
a few deviendront sides of héros .
d' other of prisonniers of guerre . some perdront of states , deviendront fous or perdront life .
their vies vacillent here as the cierges d' a église : considering that some s' éteignent , it in rallume new .
the white of peter englund s' écarte of livres d' histoire traditionnels .
it am a démenti to l' idea does the first guerre mondiale does résume that by the terrible guerre of tranchées on the front occidental .
" the beauté and the chagrin " décrit habilement d' other théâtres of guerre : the alpes , the balkans , oriental front , the mésopotamie and l' afrique eastern .
the soldats présents in this white is finding under the ruches ; l' a happening noël in égypte under the pyramides ; the mouches tsé-tsé are a problem intraitable .
this white émouvant is therefore the first page .
the guerre envahit the vies of these people such a disaster naturelle , such a ouragan katrina which pue the cordite .
when of coups of canon retentissent on loin , and that you êtes a mère on foyer , restez-vous or fuyez-vous ?
which viendra of any manner ?
almost someone can comprendre this qu' it s' is past , reliable even the reasons of this guerre .
according englund peter , " the lack of facts has been étoffé by suppositions , espérances , craintes , produce modules , théories conspirationnistes , rêves , cauchemars and rumeurs ."
" the beauté and the chagrin " suit of individus such as florence farmborough , a nourrice anglaise within l' american russe , as well as stumpf richard , a 34 marin of the flotte of haute sea allemande .
their histoires are mainly tirées of mémoires , lettres and d' other documents already publiés .
the versions of their vies may be terrifiantes or passionnantes , but are more préservées through the l' accumulation of petits moments and details concerning isolés .
the majority abordent the privation and the capacity of s' in sortir .
in racontant l' histoire d' a écolière allemande , peter englund wrote : " ersatz , partout ersatz . "
" café of remplacement , faux aluminium , imitation of caoutchouc , bandages in papier , boutons in bois ."
it continuing on the nourriture of remplacement in germany .
it décrit of the " viande faite of riz cuit écrasé in the graisse of mouton ( and finie with a faux os of bois ) ; the tabac fabriqué with of racines sèches and the peau séchée of pomme of exile ; of semelles of chaussures in bois ."
it affirme that " 837 viandes of substitution permissible are enregistrées in the production of saucisses . it trouve also 511 cafés of substitution ."
some histoires abordent l' honour and the courage .
a américain reconnaît its own pulsion envers the sauvagerie and declare resumed in the guerre : " you sentez qu' after all , c' is this to from the men were destinés , rather than that of s' asseoir in a fauteuil confortable , a cigarette and a whisky to hand , lisant a newspaper or a best-seller , and rather than that of qu' suggesting a follow-up vernis is synonyme of civilisation , and qu' it n' there without barbare derrière your chemise empesée and cloutée .
inversement , a british soldat réalise qu' it strong military of mourir , and that no the remarquera or n' there respond attention .
" when l' it is résigné to take sacrifier hope , we will be a public écrit-il " .
c' is unfortunately rather than comparable to " a homme condemned person étranglé in secret ".
d' other comments concern the déclin d' a vieille europe and new types of terreur .
" the conflit meaning more and more a histoire competition economic " wrote peter englund , " a guerre between the usines ."
it saisit l' arrivée of this qu' it next " a new espèce within the bestiaire the start of the century : the meurtrier of masse very articulé and absolutely certain idéologiquement , vêtements very taillés , which exécute its boucherie do being the case assis derrière a comptoir ."
people agissent way inattendue ; it trouve world of comportements basic that d' héroïsme .
englund peter speak of soldats which have attempted to all prices d' attraper a maladie vénérienne here of prostituées so d' prevent the service in front .
" we trouve l' " the more grotesque in the external of pus dû to the gonorrhée , that the soldats achètent and s " étalent on the central génitaux in l' earn of finir to l' hôpital ", écrit-il .
" the more désespérés is l' regulations on the feel , which take the form of a cécité to life ."
in this traduction the suédois by peter lived , the prose of peter englund is souple but not ostentatoire , upon adaptée depth d' humanité .
in dizaines of courtes scènes , it saisit the the guerre has " déclenché of surveys exclusively incontrôlables : a nationalisme particular , a révolution social , a aversion for the religion . "
people are commencent to ask why their leaders their refuse a guerre .
the meilleurs ouvrages traitant of the first guerre mondiale are often indirects , as " great war and modern memory " ( the great guerre and the mémoire moderne ) paul fussel , or " has l' ouest nothing again ", d' erich maria comment , rather than complets .
ouvrage l' of peter englund is a panthéon little conventionnel .
the end of white is the more accablante that j' aie lue in a œuvre non-fictionnelle .
i do the révélerai not .
but c' is as s' it had surgi in its white , several your total this figure page where the liste of people and brûlée with a allumette .

elizabeth thomas , porte-parole the département legal of towns , has declared that the municipalité n' has not yet been improve the reasons of procès and can therefore not do comments on the allégations .
d' after a ébauche of plaintes obtenues by the new york times , the syndicat miserait on the number of licenciements in the écoles of quartiers the most défavorisés of towns for appuyer its plainte against a inéquitable treatment , déclarant that the écoles poorest perdraient the more d' aid , given d' a sous-financement régulier .

achevée mission : the congrès trouve a agree on the question of the libye
go surely that the républicains and démocrates aient thought been reached on capitole on the question of soulèvement in lybie .
it will fallu a soulèvement réussi , the capture and the execution of the dictateur youth date muammar kadhafi that l' doubtful army .
the committee of institutional étrangères the sénat devra a decision - next tuesday , supported by president john kerry ( démocrate - massachussetts ), with the sénateurs john mccain ( républicain - arizona ) and joseph i. lieberman ( indépendant - connecticut ), applaudissant the peuple libyen for their révolte and troupes ltcm for their " courage ".
" this resolution consiste to honorer the courage of libyens considering qu' they commencent to reconstruire their countries " has declared john kerry .
" c' is a supporting bipartisan to their aspirations démocratiques ."
the langage is perhaps inoffensif but the debate on the libye n' has never been simple until now .
this been , législateurs of two partis are entrés in conflit , as well qu' with the maison blanche , on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the role militaire ground in the mission of l' otan in libye .
in june , kerry and mccain have created a resolution to permit l' employment limité of surveys militaires ltcm in libye .
the draft loi has been vaincu by a widest outside bipartisane and n' has never have l' decide d' a vote on sénat .
but the same day of l' failure of the draft loi , the chambre of members has also rejeté a position to reduce the financing of opérations ltcm in libye .
the mission army is therefore upheld under a forme of legislative purgatoire - the congrès enough contrarié for criticising the management of the mission by obama , but not for him couper l' herbe under the pied .
indécision l' the congrès has been dépassée by the événements .
tripoli is tombé under the insurgés in août and kadhafi has been tué the 20 last october .
the mission of otan l' s' is officiellement terminée the 31 october .
the sénat can now take action .
the resolution of committee of institutional étrangères " congratulate the peuple libyen for his courage and its détermination extraordinaires with the freedom and congratulate " men and women of armées surveys ltcm and their partenaires of the coalition engagés in opérations militaires for protéger the peuple libyen , for their courage and professionnalisme fantastiques ."
the resolution also affirme " l' national interest ground to achieving a transition irréversible and réussie towards the démocratie in libye ."
the new position remportera-t-elle all the supporting the commission of affaires étrangères the sénat or divisera-t-elle the législateurs as last june ?
the sénateur and president of the commission d. richard lugar ( indépendant ) s' is opposé to the last version .
his porte-parole has declared last monday that richard d. lugar n' had not yet lu the any last version of new draft .
within the capitole , the chambre must favour this week one amendment to the constitution for get a balanced budget , a priority legislative for almost all the républicains the congrès , and a few démocrates .
the position , soutenue by the républicain bob goodlatte ( virginie ), constituera the first amendment constitutional relatif on budget , or any other question , to get a vote of plancher to the chambre or the sénat .
d' other législateurs n' have hitherto not réussi to do something their amendments but n' is not without be attempted .
l' amendment of goodlatte done part of 68 amendments constitutionnels to be been sitting in congrès , on a widest éventail of sujets .
some are récurrents - the same draft loi tabled to the time to the chambre and sénat - and d' other are of légères variations d' a previous .
account will at least 15 versions to the chambre simply of l' amendment for a balanced budget , and another poignée which " contrôleraient the spending fédérales ".
some of these projects of loi are uniform , but donnent to their soutiens - particularly the new républicains which souhaitent dorer their cv - the chance of is vanter d' be l' " author " d' such a position .
the loi on supervision of the budget ( budget control act ) approuvée in août final demandait the vote of the chambre and sénat on l' amendment d' a balanced budget .
in march , 58 sénateurs it voted in favour d' a resolution not contraignante based l' idea d' a follow-up amendment .
the delà - the budget , several states souhaitent limiter the number of mandats durant which the states of the congrès may help , tandis that josé e. serrano ( démocrate - new york ) would rise the frost two mandats for the presidents .
jesse l. jackson jr . ( démocrate - illinois ) has tabled a multitude d' amendments garantissant the law to éducation of quality and the soins health , among other sujets .
one amendment interdisant the mariage between individus equally sexe is perpétuellement tabled , as l' amendment interdisant the profanation the drapeau .
some législateurs souhaitent also permit l' annulation of lois fédérales if the two third of member there are opposés .
also avides qu' have been the states d' offer of amendments , they are not also rapides in the past .
in the 111 until congrès , the législateurs have tabled amendments 77 , and introduit 66 in the 110 e.
the cadence ralentit by the start of years 1990 when the states proposaient generally more 150 amendments all the two years , d' after the uk made by the bibliothèque the sénat .
but these amendments n' not very much more of success in qu' they have today .
the final amendment to be been deficiencies - the 27 until - has been ratifié in 1992 but tabled on congrès in 1789.

it arrive to draw one or two doigts only , with the encouragements of his mari .
a few months later , gabrielle giffords is assise in a fauteuil roulant considering that the médecins theory him to implement of action simple .
a signe the top .
a mouvement of lèvres .
and finally , its first mot : " from ".
a few jours later , gabrielle giffords has chuchoté a other mot (" toast ") ask of changer the menu of his small step déjeuner .

in of l' entrevue with diane sawyer , gabrielle giffords , which happening each item two p.m. with the médecins , has declared do not take remind the fusillade .
according to its mari , it was in late of reading him a article on the fusillade the 12 march lorsqu'elle l' has stoppé and requested for the first time of environmental on the six people tuées during of l' incident .

therefore i dirais " , " gabby , tu n' as not been battue ", has affirmé mark kelly .
tu as juste been massacrée .
and tu vas t' in sortir , te rétablir and return even more forte that never .
more pitié that of respect for the troupes
événement l' : a gala to wall street for récolter of million of dollars for the vétérans without foyer of towns in new york .
kid rock has chanté a ballade on l' impuissance , the frustration and the perte .
of centaines of soldats , marins , pilotes and marines focused on him .
the foule in costume-cravate s' is implementation rose to its feet for l' acclamer .
" the militaires , men and women , are considérés as of héros ", has declared david saltzman , organisateur of the collecte of funds in the spring .
a haut-gradé militaire now in gala something participait also l' amiral mike mullen , leader d " état-major of armées ground , has seen the role of troupes different way .
" they have been presented as a way orphelin d' ", has wrote the haut-gradé militaire in a courrier electronic .
i am of course that the organisateurs had of good intentions .
i know .
but this n " was not of enforcement . juste of the pitié .
the impressions imperative contradictoires illustrent institutional hard which are installées between the militaires and a public américain passionné but often distant .
of louanges are prodiguées to troupes for their sacrifices .
but they have a pity prices , déclarent few militaires .
the public is more and more s' as it was désolé for men and women in uniforme .
" we are not of all of victims " has declared the brigadier general sean b. macfarland , which has dirigé the troupes in irak and partira bientôt for l' afghanistan .
" but go that the only way to we support should be in we enfermer in the role esprits d' malchanceux ."
it is s' d' a very sensitive issue for the leaders militaires , which do not souhaitent paraître not reconnaissants or disagreed with the public qu' they serve .
they réalisent also that the colère of troupes revenantes of the guerre the vietnam has been very pire .
well , most of the conversations on the pitié have place in any confidentialité among the vétérans .
after the retour of its two fils the combat with the marines , colonel retraité mark cancian the has avertis that the public considérerait their service under two allow .
some of the regarderaient with respect because they have been face to insurgés and have voyagé towards of contrées lointaines .
d' other is demanderaient if " a vétéran in colère and violent is cache under the surface " has declared cancian , which s' is battu in irak and is revenu for working in the government to washington .
lorsqu'il recherchait employment , any politicians , it sentait that a few people who faisaient him passer the entretiens demandaient way subtile s' it would be able to take the coup under the stress d' employment exigeant to washington immédiatement after its retour the combat .
" when you abordez the issue of service , you êtes confronté to impressions négatives ", remind the colonel cancian lorsqu'il speak to its fils .
the difficulties of militaires surgissent , in part , indifférence l' army envers the guerres .
the victoires are rarement félicitées by a countries also little familier with l' american and which voit little d' avantages directs of guerres in irak and in afghanistan .
" as nation , we do valorisons more l' héroïsme in the same way as for the second section guerre mondiale declare resumed the lieutenant general retraité david barno , which has dirigé the troupes in afghanistan .
the place of this , her work of men policies and peuple is concentrent relativises on the in-depth evaluation of souffrances d' a militaire .
the troupes are acknowledged to the number of périodes services endurées , the number amis d' perdus or l' étendue of blessures .
l' american to pushes croissante of sévir against the violeurs
this week , an audience capitale decides whether 28 men and women iront in procès against l' american for a should supposée on of viols .
the case échéant , centaines of plaignants prépareront the next .
the soldat of 1 until re classe elizabeth lyman was âgée of 25 years and enceinte of 11 weeks the dawn where it affirme not been violée by a soldat .
c " was in october 2008 it rentrait to its caserne to miramar test station , north of san diego , following dîné with a ami , lorsqu'elle has already continued a pack of bières .
it him has requested s' it could the rejoindre in its chambre for boire a verre .
" c " was a message d' alarme " declare resumed elizabeth lyman .
but the texane has put to say his inquiétude .
i have j' pensé : not , it has 19 years .
" it is of texas " dit-elle .
" j' aurai dû monitor my intuition ."
a few minutes after be entré in the chambre d' elizabeth lyman , l' homme l' has attrapée by derrière , jetée by exile and violée , prétend-elle .
this week , 18 november , elizabeth lyman and 27 other militaires , some further into service and d' other not , attendront with anxiété the decision of justice during d' a historical procès which déroulera to arlington , virginie , and which decides whether a procès porté against l' ancien secrétaire to the defending robert gates and his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , will take place .
these are accusés latest not to be stoppé the généralisation of viols within l' american , allant well to l' uk the right constitutionnels of soldats .
classé february , by susan burke , a avocate of washington , the procès impliquait initially 17 plaignants . this number s' is enough to 28 the months following - 25 women and men 3 , all prétendant not been violés or abusés sexuellement by members soldats . they also prétendent that l' american n' has not enquêté , poursuivi reliable fourni of justice adaptée after the attaques alléguées .
susan burke declare resumed s' in take to militaires galonnées , because the problem commence by them .
" l' american is a structure verticale " dit-elle .
" which are the individus in position d " éradiquer the culture of représailles leaders ." ?
avocate l' declare resumed also that since the months of february , it has been contactée by almost 400 other survivants , which the majority pourraient do part of poursuites judiciaires responsibilities .
its strategy : the place of rassembler all the plaignants in this money after - mettant well all its œufs in the same panier - it intentera several procès , if necessary , to keep the pushes .
équipe l' the defending , for the département the defending , dirigée by l' avocat américain neil macbride , has tabled a point for rejeter the case .
the documents judiciaires , established newsweek , détaillent strategy of defending , and descriptive that l' american can not be poursuivie by soldats into service or not for the blessures causées in surveys armées .
according to a decision of 1950 of the court suprême , dénommée the doctrine feres , the government fédéral n' is not responsible blessures subies by known in active service .
" the mal allégué is inhérent on service militaire of plaignants " indiquent the documents .
the département the defending has dragged of do everything commentaire .
something have changé since the years 50.
considering that women n' have not , officiellement , the law d' goes on combat , this distinction n' is inscrite that on papier : of the of front of récentes guerres are rarement simply masculines .
in irak as in afghanistan , the équipes of soldats women jouent a role more and more important , particularly for entrer in contact with the women local .
result : on these two guerres , 150 women soldats have perdu life - two third in situation of combat .
it is time for l' american of is modernised declare resumed susan burke .
it n' is not only to pursuing this combat : three other procès are in during more of siens .
has l " école of law yale , forms of services accorded of vétérans prepare a money after against the four main académies militaires not supposedly encourage a ambiance misogyne .
secondly , the fondation d' to objective not lucratif vietnam veterans of america to prepare a procès against l' american , concentrant on the diagnostics of " troubles of the personnalité " attribués to victims of viols so to have congé - a fact relatively ordinaire , according to the activistes such qu' anu bhagwaru of the service women's action network ( net d' action of women militaires ), a group for the right of homme l' .
his group has intenté a procès in december to l' administration of vétérans , in the accusant of practical discriminatoires in the way of traiter the requests for topical d' avantages to the people déclarant be series d' a agression sexuelle in the service .
neuf projects of loi indépendants the sides of others have been sitting in congrès by a mélange bipartisan of sénateurs and representatives , proposant diverses solutions .
in 2010 3,158 agressions sexuelles have been enregistrées d' after the relations d' intervention and kind of agressions sexuelles ( sexual assault prevention and response monopolies ) of the département the defending .
but it is connu that the number agressions d' sexuelles is sous-estimé . it d' after the own estimation the pentagone , this chiffre represent environ 13,5% of 19,000 incidents survenus this année-là .
the report paru in march étudie also the percentage of poursuites judiciaires : in 2010 20% cases enregistrés in l' american have done l' decide d' a procès - the the percentage of the system judiciaire civil .
the plaignants of money after l' of susan burke décrivent their agression as the initial d' a great deal of traumatismes .
in money after l' of lyman , inform the police militaire the viol less d' a now after the facts .
this nuit-là , dit-elle him , one has requested of raconter 11 time in details concerning his viol to various policiers , médecins and commandants .
it has subi a " rape kit " ( littéralement a kit of viol ), and the sang of his agresseur - dû to coupure her bras - has been thought in his lit .
six months later , avril 2009 elizabeth lyman is assise face a juge , to a procès during duquel it the questionne on its institutional sexuelles with his small step ami more tôt the journée of his agression .
six people have executed as témoins of moralité for l' author of crime , which has fini by be acquitté .
" i am souviens off the where the verdict has been rendu " declare resumed elizabeth lyman .
" j' i cru that j' allais start to be contractions . i am implementation to crier after the court ."
" j' i have been placée in unité psychiatrique , and when i am enforceable , i am souviens be said in my commandant " this n' was not his procès but the mien "."
elizabeth lyman has been contrainte of consulter a psychiatre militaire , which has fini by diagnostiquer a trouble of the personnalité , the rendant inapte on service .
in january 2010 she has been renvoyée under the termes less qu' honorables , l' empêchant of recevoir quelconque competitive .
est-ce that l' money after lyman and other plaignants avanceront or not , c' is a youth histoire , declare resumed john turley , professeur of law to the faculté of law l' université of washington .
however , why remarked , " has my opinion they should be able ". degree
only this doctrine critiquée since his introduction is trouve between them and a verdict .
j' i have always criticised the doctrine feres .
l' american is trouve of décennies derrière because it n' has not the same avantages and levels of dissuasion posés by the responsibility .
" the opportunities are lourdement against them ... but it is important qu' they essaient ", ajoute-t-il .
these changent whilst simply when the many have the willingness of is battre .
if the procès do not vehicles in their favour , susan burke , l' avocate of plaignants , rassemblera its centaines d' other plaignants for d' other procès .
" we continuerons of we battre against l' american on this question as qu' it n' there will not of reform affirme-t-elle " .
where solved " to what we mourrions , l' one or other l' of two options .
the murs have feel : the chercheurs you étudient on facebook
before i believe the new visage of l' particular droite in europe , anders behring breivik was a simple gars highly destructive hand of its opinion anti-immigration in keeping .
monday , breivik , which has not been taken reconnu d' a folie meurtrière in norvège in july laissant 77 victims , has been confronté to his first procès .
considering that breivik has is only , it was loin of l' be on the cyberespace : it had past a great part of the time précédant l' attaque on his ordinateur , to discuss with few sides of million of nationalistes which soutiennent the groups d' particular droite on the sites of social networks .
after the tragédie of this been , the chercheurs souhaitent in more on these people .
but how the solutions ?
children ... connectez-vous to facebook .
" we have met qu' it n " was not if difficult that ça of the find ourselves ", declare resumed jamie bartlett , author main d' a report submitted much by the group of demos myself on the populisme numérique in europe .
facebook regorge of both d' environmental personnelles , affirme jamie bartlett , that the chercheurs pourraient answered spent l' tool publicitaire the site to strike the people qu' they cherchent with a specific scientifique - the how mercaticiens the refuse since of years .
l " équipe of jamie bartlett has découvert qu' a demi-million of states are fans of groups d' particular droite in europe . it the has ciblés with of annonces , but the place intending to a new group or product , the annonces invitaient the utilisateurs to respond to it . the questions posées concernaient their level d' éducation , their attitudes to violence and their optimism comment to their own future .
in entrant in contact with these people are intended to facebook , jamie bartlett and its members have been interroger 10,000 partisans of 14 partis d' particular droite in 11 european countries - without quitter the bureau .
" c' is a new way to research ", declare resumed jamie bartlett .
some results are not just the surprenants : the partisans in keeping with groups of droite are rather than of men , young people and against l' immigration .
but étonnamment , " those associent activisme in keeping and hors-ligne are more raisonnables , more démocratiques and less violents that those still derrière their écran d' ordinateur ."
l " étude of demos n' is qu' one example on how facebook grew the new tool incontournable total of scientifiques .
the groups myself , the chercheurs in médecine and politologues utilisent the site to see all the sujets which touchent the questions of health as the harmful social , intended to " j' aime ", publications on the murs and mises to item of statuts .
with more 800 million d' utilisateurs actifs which ajoutent average three contenus by off , the " supernova of data " génère a explosion in matters of research , augmentant the number of business of research which behalf of the site clearly in the under of almost 800% by report to the last five years .
for some chercheurs , l' competitive of facebook réside in the fact qu' it serves d' you see people that you do not pourriez approcher in the rue .
" before , when you tentiez d' effectuer of enquêtes on the people of the party national british , it was very difficult to identify the ."
" you deviez you make the party , but they do you really never autorisé to entrer ", declare resumed jamie bartlett .
" facebook avoid this - you directly access to their environmental . "
d' other disent that the site may offer a way d' identify and traiter the problems sanitaires and social .
according to a étude récente the d. megan moreno of l' université the wisconsin-madison , and its members , young people étudiants which parlaient on facebook of their exploits in state d' ébriété had much more opportunities d' be alcooliques that the étudiants discrets to this issue .
megan moreno suggest that the members of étudiants , such as advisers , pouvaient surveiller the site and wished to assist iso a étudiant which the statut parlerait too often d' alcool .
" you do not pouvez traiter a problem if you do the diagnostiquez not ", dimitri christakis , co-auteur of megan moreno and directeur the relations to health , the comportement and the development of enfants to l' institut research for the enfants situé to seattle , affirme the post washington .
" we know how to identify the enfants to risks , and which seraient in a other case not reconnus ."
facebook also accède constamment to environmental of its utilisateurs .
l " équipe the site which s' representing of data has close the statistics on the situation amoureuse and the saint valentin , the catastrophic participation taking of mi-mandat of 2010 and a indice of national bonheur ( through to environmental simply - including the champions of the freedom numérique have during long awaited supported that the site could make disponible his trésor of data to d' other people to fins research ).
but the utilisateurs of facebook savent that the site the observed , that ça their plaisent or not - in the key to be able to using the scrabble with a ami which trouve to thousands of kilomètres , the site is autorisé to accéder to your environmental .
but that is passe-t-il when the utilisateurs of facebook refuse part d' it which they n' have not hear discussing ?
considering that the chercheurs have fire so summit comment to the way to collate the environmental words qu' in passant by l' internet , it is any other time in keeping .
" i do not believe qu' a large number utilisateurs d' aient already pensé to the fact qu' a chercheur such see their profil " declare resumed neil selwyn , sociologue on laboratoire of connaissances of londres , d' after a étude of 2000-2006 qu' it has mené in observant the murs facebook of its étudiants .
" world qu' they sachent , the exchange n' depend vus that by their amis ."
then preaching the question of méthodologie .
even without passer by the internet , it n' there no garantie that the issue d' a étude be complètement honnête .
on facebook , it is impossible to finding the degree of truth d' a profil or on the mur d' a utilisateur .
" what you dites on facebook and what you made in fact are two present totally various ", affirme neil selwyn .
c' is why , despite its experience as chercheur technological neil selwyn believe qu' a bloc-notes and a stylo still the meilleurs essential tools that l' it such spent .
" no able substitute the world adequately and the contact with the people , déclare-t-il " .
" the social studies are censées make l' deal social - and the social , this is not n' face a ordinateur ."

it was certainly a créateur and a rêveur . it s' identifiait to a hippie but was also very méticuleux and debates , as well qu' a améliorateur d' organigrammes - a homme which croyait that many leaders d' companies souffraient d' a " maladie their laissant feel qu' a idea géniale done 90% work ... [ but ] a quantité effort to work manuel a bridge idea géniale d' a product d' exception ."
in 1995 bob cringely développait the great deal télévisée " triumph of the nerds ". this great deal retrace the naissance of l' ordinateur , and it s' assoit during more d' a now with steve jobs for a youth and rare conversation .
has this époque-là , this faisait environ 10 years that steve jobs had dû quitter apple . it travaillait already dur on its new business informatique next , to a adopting populaire of l' internet .
considering qu' a small part of entretien l' with cringely is utilisée in nerds , it declare resumed that the main copies have disparu in the transport .
c' is simply after the execution of steve jobs qu' a vidéo complète is retrouvée in the garage the réalisateur .
this vidéo , légèrement remontée , is the basis of the film of 68 minutes intitulé steve jobs : the lost interview , which will diffusée on cinéma wednesday and thursday prochains .
for quelqu'un of connu for détester the entretiens approfondis , steve jobs seems here étonnamment enthousiaste d' presented the philosophies technologiques and its commerciales strategies .
and incroyablement attentive to : observance .
on four points various durant l' entrevue , the réponses coming a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 limited myself , durant why steve jobs pèse clearly its pensées , in the objective d' a precise response .
it découvre also moments where the perfectionnisme of steve jobs ressurgit , where it seems impatient d' hear the questions of cringely , combat donnant of coups of coude for do hasten and passer to issues or sujets of greater importance .
filmé before l " ère of pixar , l' ipod or l' iphone , it trouve one étrangement prescient on lost interview . steve jobs évalue this qu' it consider of right or mauvais among other companies and done hand of its own vision on l' future of l' informatique .
c' is a time of reading ex posthumes of the carrière of steve jobs , but there will of inhabitant and d' inspirant on l' homme that we voyons here , the rêveur anxieux to the day of grandeur .
it has a vision on the something may be and must be .
it is the explique then the mentioning of light in œuvre .
voici a récapitulatif rapid of seven séquences remarquables of lost interview :
on the way in which he has appris to diriger a company :
" durant all these years , j' i have always requested : ' why faites-vous something ?" and réponses are constamment the same : ' oh , simply because qu' must be the do .'"
no know why , no réfléchit in-depth evaluation to present in a company .
c' is what i have j' découvert .
steve jobs continuing in donnant details concerning on its efforts to simplifier the comptabilité here apple .
perplexe to comment how costs depend enregistrés - it débute often by a section costs standard " évalué to view of nez , then ajusté with a " variation " - it has développé a usine automatisée which garantissait the calcul specific costs commerciaux .
on l' appropriateness of using a turn to the pape :
steve jobs raconte l' anecdote of the " boîte bleue " qu' it has créée with steve wozniak - a appareil which servait to pirater the networks téléphoniques and téléphoner gratuitement in longue-distance .
appareil l' has done l' decide many écrits on préalable , but l' euphorie of steve jobs here in its description of the boîte bleue as a although every d' appropriation is contagieuse .
it décrit the him and wozniak have testé the boîte using a public téléphone , passant appeal then in is connectant d' a net at & t to a other do contournant world of satellites as possible .
" we enveloppions the boule in various whilst a demi-douzaine of time and you hurliez in the public téléphone and ça arrivait you a minute later on public téléphone d' to say , " explique jobs in riant .
" we fully young people and intended to this boîte bleue , we have appris that we pouvions nous-mêmes create accomplished able supervise of billion of dollars d' infrastructure in the world entier . "
we do not connaissions great time all the two , but we have su inventer a small time able supervise of great whilst . this meticulous a basic incroyable , and i do not think qu' apple might a off existé without this .
steve jobs continuing in racontant a merveilleux turn that him and wozniak have put the point : it has téléphoné on vatican with the boîte bleue on beau areas of the dawn in is highly destructive passer for henry kissinger and has requested to discuss the pape .
considering that several members of the hiérarchie catholique are convoqués on areas of the dawn on the diplomate américain , the two complices partent in fou rire juste before that the pape itself not be réveillé .
on his love with the technologie ( and démarchage of bill hewlett ) :
has l " âge of 12 years , to the chasse to pièces détachées for fabriquer a fréquencemètre , it cherche the numéro of bill hewlett in l' annuaire and combat happening a coup of fil .
little after their conversation of 20 minutes , steve jobs obtient a job d' been part-time here hewlett-packard .
" this has chipped influence magnificently on thinking . c " was the only business that j' had seen in this âge-là and this has formé my définition d' a company and how employés are treaties ."
steve jobs is by the light grew l' one of the employés hp to visiter the laboratoires research of l' business , situés to palo alto , where he has découvert the " first ordinateur of bureau never conçu ."
it was also worst qu' a valise , possédait a small step tube cathodique . j' in am tombé amoureux .
adolescent l' that j " étais is retourné here hp and has commencé to écrire programmes for this machine .
on improvisation l' of l' innovation .
has several moments in l' interview , steve jobs speak d' inventer of new products on a coup of top .
the start of its carrière , considering qu' it s' installe for vendre few cartes of circuits imprimés , a customer ask him d' assembler a ordinateur complet .
travaillant to only 30 jours of crédit , it dût s' focus of l' assemblage well that the livraison of appareils finis .
later , among apple , it is souvient problems rencontrées for develop a souris d' ordinateur :
" i am souviens of grosses disputes ... that i criait dessus in prétendant qu' i should five years [ for fabriquer a souris which coûterait $ 300 ]. j' in i have held quite , i am sorti and am allé improve a concepteur ."
quatre-vingt-dix jours later , we had a souris that we pouvions fabriquer for $ 15 and which s' avérait incroyablement fiable .
on the great companies which s' essoufflent :
although before qu' it informing revivre apple , steve jobs had anticipé the many leaders industry allaient is indicator and forget supervision of their hand of market .
" admettons that you travailliez here ibm or xerox , you made a best copieur or a better imprimante , and after ?"
you the treaties of the market , therefore l' business do not meeting more success .
the ventes and the marketing may the do enacting , therefore [ are these types of people ] which finissent by diriger companies and known spécialisé in product are put to l " gulf of taken of decisions .
the génie in product which has conduit to this position of treaties is complètement pourri by the people which may not imaginer concevoir a right product to a mauvais product - the work manuel requis .
c' is which s' is product here xerox ...
xerox might have been détenir any l' industry informatique .
it might have been do ten times its scale stand . xerox might have been the microsoft of years 90. ..
they have arraché the défaite to the success .
on l' innovation as forme artistique :
" a énorme part of work manuel a bridge idea géniale d' a product superb ... in a position that you développez this idea , change and grandit ."
you apprenez much on its subtilités .
there has compromis to do something ... some that you do not pouvez do , the électrons the may , the verre , the robots , the usines also .
you devez garder thousands of something to l' spirit ( these concepts ) in the assemblant the unes to the other .
finally , the decisions are taken by goût known . it is s' d' essayer of you presented to meilleurs products that the men have set up to bring about , and essayer d' d' making these whilst the product that you créez .
picasso said a day that the many artistes copient and that the major artistes volent .
we have always honte of voler d' excellentes produce .
c' is part which rend macintosh superb . the people who travaillaient dessus depend of musiciens , poètes , zoologistes , historiens , which are simply avérés the meilleurs scientifiques informatiques in the world .
if this n' is for the science informatique , really they have of something extraordinaires in a other area .
scalia and thomas dînent with of adversaires of law of health considering that the court is réunit
the item where the court suprême is réunit to huis closed to examine the question of discorde policy , namely if l' opposition to the loi of the president obama of health will entendue , two of its juges , antonin scalia and clarence thomas , have been remarqués during d' a dîner parrainé by the cabinet d' advocates which défendra l' money after towards haute court .
évènement l' is situait last thursday , when the neuf juges have declared réunis for a conference to discuss the pétitions for examination .
l' a of affaires in question concernait a procès intenté by 26 member contestant the reform of soins health ambitieuse votée by the congrès l' last year , a loi which was a point of ralliement for militants conservateurs to l' running nationale .
the juges have substance d' hear the plainte adopted , a argument monumental of 5 h 30 is attendu in march next , and the result will probability safer to promote the déstabilisation the course of présidentielle 2012 which will in plein essor for the decision of the courts will rendue .
l' avocat which sitting face the courts and argumentera on the rejet the loi , will vraisemblablement paul clement , which has servi as solliciteur general ground durant l' administration of george w. bush .
the cabinet legal of clément , pllc bancroft , has done part of the two douzaines of cabinets which have aidé to parrainer the annual dîner society fédéraliste ( federalist society ), a group of youth date dédié to défendre the principles conservateurs accorded .
a further cabinet which has parrainé the dîner , jones day , represent a l' of associations commerciales which have contesté the loi , the fédération nationale companies own business ( national federation of independent business ).
a further promoteur has been the géant pharmaceutique pfizer inc , which , who is a énorme enjeu tunnel in the result of the litige .
the dîner s' is taken at a hôtel washington few p.m. after the conference of the courts on l' money after .
s' there was , among other , mitch mcconnell , républicain top of the sénat and adversaire politicians the loi of health .
the vedette attach the dîner ? scalia and thomas .
this is not n' again : the two juges have been présents to évènements society fédéraliste during of years .
and it n' there has nothing which aille to l' uk of the rules of déontologie .
in fact , the juges are exemptés of the code of conduct which régit the action of juges fédéraux .
s' they l' depend , they argumenteraient without doubt by the code of canon 4 c, which stipule : " a juge can assister to collectes of funds of organisations liées the right and other that the juge do not be such a intervenant , a invité d' honour , or figurant on the programme d' a follow-up évènement ".
but the présence of scalia and thomas elections to two of cabinets d' advocates of money after l' , as well qu' to a company had a interest mass tunnel , has suffi to alarmer the activistes of l' éthique gouvernementale .
" this violation of l' éthique and superbe indifférence to l' connection the code contredit the appeared of several juges that the court no-smoking the same rules introduced to all the other juges fédéraux ", has declared bob edgar , president of common commend .
" the juges buvaient and dînaient and a collecte of funds gala with of advocates which have cases in the face of the courts ". instance
their présence and their participation in the collecte of funds of this évènement démonte any réclamation d' impartialité , and is inacceptable .
scalia and thomas have shown little d' connection to the criticisms affirmant qu' they mélangent too facilement the affaires of the court with l' agenda of groups such as fédéraliste society .
and the femme of thomas , ginni , is a militante conservatrice of haut-profil .
by any , the conservateurs prétendent that c' is the juge elena kagan which has a problem d' éthique , and not scalia and thomas .
kagan has been solliciteur general of l' administration d' obama when the initial oppositions to the loi have been portées in terms of courts of first instance .
its criticisms have pushes for kagan is récuse to hear the case , disant qu' it s' was too investie in the defending the loi for impartiale .
kagan n' has given every indication qu' it the ferait .
enregistre boeing a commande record of 18 billion of dollars for of had of keeping
the compagnie aérienne emirates commande 50 boeing 777 had of keeping bi-couloirs , with the chance d' in acheter 20 of more .
vend boeing also six boeing dreamliners to oman test , a market estimé to more d' a milliard of dollars .
it n' there has nothing d' extraordinaire to this qu' a compagnie reçoive a commande contemplant 50 of its products .
c' is materialise a money after when the compagnie in question is the constructeur d' had boeing and that the level of these 50 had reached the somme record of 18 billion of dollars .
all too incroyable is of which boeing has received this commande : the moyen-orient , a mine d' well grandissante of responsibilities commandes d' had .

boeing has expected in salon aéronautique of dubaï of 2011 that the compagnie aérienne is also susceptible d' acheter 20 had more , which élèverait total the level of the commande to 26 billion of dollars .
d' a other say , boeing has indiqué monday that the compagnie oman test has commandé six boeing 787 - 8 surnommés dreamliners , a model which flatte d' smaller economies of carburant and commodités for the passagers .
the level of these six appareils élève to more d' s " a milliard of dollars .
" c' is clearly very positive for boeing , " has declared neal dihora , analyste the morningstar .
" these clients in particular have a immense value ."
the moyen-orient , the countries producteurs of pétrole possèdent very their compagnies aériennes .
they have therefore not only the levels of payer these had , but a increase the prices of carburant - d' habitude préjudiciable for the compagnies aériennes because it represent their frais the most important - not their would not if nuisible since the countries gagnerait of l' money with the increase the prices of pétrole .
c' is a point important because these compagnies shall be less susceptibles that d' other d' annuler or différer their commandes d' had when the prices of pétrole increase , has pointed out dihora .
" they have a couverture of military naturelle ", any said .
the commande d' emirates reinforces the prédominance of boeing on the market of had gros-porteurs and aid to apply a brake to the tentative d' empiètement the concurrent airbus with his avion has 3 50.
the success of boeing on salon of l' aéronautique arrive four months after l' annonce d' airbus of reporter the débuts of the more version of l' has 3 50 which rivalise directly with the boeing 777 - 300 until r.
repousse airbus its débuts for in increasing the poussée light to the request of its clients d' drive its capacity of employees and his autonomie .
the action of the compagnie boeing have indeed 1.5% the 67,94 dollars .

the pentagone digère already 450 billion of dollars of réductions for the coming decade , but craint now qu' totalling publishing of 600 dollars or more compressions be imminent if the congrès do not manage to a agree on the spending .
" the impacts of these réductions seraient dévastateurs for the prosecutor ", has declared panetta in a letter to sénateurs john mccain , r-arizona , and lindsey graham , r-south carolina .
he has declared that l' failure of the congrès to achieving a agree budgétaire résultant in that l' we call the séquestration , 23% cost of réductions well that the gel many new projects .
" a reduction also important , employed well without discernement , rendrait the majority of our navires and our of construction inexécutables - you do not pouvez acheter three quarters d' a navire or d' a building - and brought up affects atteinte to other efforts of modernisation ", wrote panetta to sénateurs .
" we serions also contraint of we séparer d' a number of our known civil and , because the aim would be imposée if rapidly , we should almost certainly envoyer of civils in congé without salaire with d' achieved l' objective ."
" these changes ébranleraient the faith of those who soutiennent our militaires and endommageraient properly our preparing ."
the réductions toucheraient iso the troupes combattantes , further education panetta .
" that financing in time of guerre of comptes of opérations of contingence to l' abroad not be directly affected by the séquestration , the efforts of guerre seraient négativement affectés by the perturbations lived in the budgets of basis ", has averti panetta .
" known contractant would réduit , entraînant delays in the contrats and the supervision of contrat which soutiennent the guerre ".
" known gérant the salaires would réduit , entraînant delays of paiement to employers of guerre , and supporting legal and would perturbé ". policy
the two sénateurs had wrote to panetta 10 jours more tôt , demandant details concerning on l' impact potential compressions automatiques on the prosecutor of defending .
" the result d' a séquestration on the département the defending might déclencherait a déclin rapid ground as leader mondial incontesté of the militaire ". frighteningly
" we are farouchement opposés to this action draconienne ", have declared the sénateurs in a common communiqué monday après-midi during the publication of the letter of panetta .
this n' " is not a result with which we can vivre , and this n' is certainly not amongst that we should imposer ".
" the séquestration is a menace for the interests of safety nationale ground , and it should not be to take produire ".
the letter of panetta and avertissements récents of sénateurs augmentent the pushes for a compromis budgétaire or appeal to exempter the pentagone of réductions , remains to improve .
panetta has been more and more virulent to the issue of compressions possible , even if it is reached itself in as safe poste the pentagone cumulant of years d' expertise of the budget in congrès and the maison blanche and realise qu' it was confronté to offer hard .
to a conference of press the week passée , the secrétaire to the defending has peint a thing with regard sombre of what may survenir - a militaire with a coquille , but not of noyau .
" c' is a navire without marins ".
" c' is a brigade without balles ".
" c' is a avion of chasse , without quite of pilotes formés ".
" c' is a tigre in papier , a american of casernes , brussels and bombes which n' have not of soldats formés capables d' accomplir the mission ", has declared panetta during of its préliminaires comments on pentagone .
" c' is a power déprimée , mal préparée and incapable of to experience of adversaires potentiels ".
" of facto , to invite l' agression .."
in a addendum to its lettres to mccain and graham , panetta has énoncés specifically how new réductions pouvaient " générer d' important risks opérationnels : period of response to crises , conflits and disasters ; sévères limites to our capacity to we déployer and we engager in the world ; and military assumé inacceptable in opérations of combat holds ".
and panetta has declared that some of major projects of defending may passer on couperet , including those already testés and some juste to premiers stades the planning .
this liste incluait the fighter f 3 5 joint strike , a new bombardier exceptional , the sous-marin balistique of new génération , the new navire of combat littoral and the new véhicule of losing , which remplacerait the humvee of l' american and marine .
a term development and essais the f 3 5 may générer 80 billion of dollars d' economies on 10 years , but its partisans disent that c' is a fundamental étape d' improving and response to menaces potentielles of the chine and d' other rivaux .

loin d' be a jeu of society semblable to , say quite , charades , where l' objective is to s' écrier : " i t' i have held ", the détection of the tromperie is a branche sérieuse of connaissances fondées on of data scientifiques recueillies during the last six décennies in prestigieuses colleges had mené a research in-depth evaluation of such projects , particularly in psychologie and in physiologie .
a outcome of research is that the mythes the most anciens on the mensonge have been démystifiés .
the menteurs you regardent in the feel .
they do bégayent , rougissent or s' agitent not always .
do not conclude that the menteurs are hard to détecter and hard to démasquer .
a détecteur of mensonge qualifié can découvrir the truth in examinant structure of the included , the micro-expressions faciales , the training of the question and the time of response .
i have j' past several years to examine the results scientifiques in the large until always émergent the familiar on the tromperie , and it is clear that the détection of the tromperie is a competence moderne which is children to apprendre and useful for naviguer in our society complex - especially if your responsibility universities incluent particularly l' embauche , the entrevues , the negotiation or the management .
the many menteurs are habiles to reading , in the mettant to l' aise , gérant their own émotions and intuitivement détectant how the other the perceive .
we know d' after of recherches that the extravertis mentent more that the introvertis , that the men say more mensonges " centrés on them " considering that women disent more mensonges " centrés on the other " - habituellement for protéger the sentiments of quelqu'un - that the people mariées mentent less often to their partenaires that the people not mariées ( but that the mensonges qu' they racontent have tendance to be facing ).
we also know that if you êtes perçu as a mécréant , the other seem is sentir less coupable of you mentir .
how pouvez-vous say if quelqu'un ment ?
all d' firstly , observez the comportement normal of your issue .
c' is this qu' we call " achieving the data repères ".
this aid to provide a point of reference for mesurer changes ultérieurs .
observez the posture of your issue , the rire , the quality vocale .
you devez whether quelqu'un remue normalement its feet in permanence so not to lancer of accusations injustes when you see remuer the feet in areas of the meeting .
then recherchez of indices of comportements trompeurs verbaux and not verbaux .
considérez these indices as of drapeaux rouges , not of show of the tromperie .
people may trompeurs immobiliser the high until the place essaient of is vivid of their histoire , they can pointer their feet towards the something , will pencher towards enforceable , changer of posture manner significant or present a soulagement of " post-interview " - a soupir exagéré of soulagement , a change to posture when all the questions hard are experience .
the interrogateurs indiquent often faussement that l' entretien is terminé juste to seek to déclencher the réaction post-interview .
also , made attention to the vocabulaire of your issue .
the célèbre scott peterson has dérapé using the past all in prétendant that its femme recently was vivante , déclenchant a research nationale for the find ourselves .
the individus trompeurs may also draw a langage distancé : " i n' not have held of institutional sexuelles with this femme ... mlle lewinsky " or repeat entièrement a difficult issue .
the indicators verbaux most schemes are subtils .
quelqu'un can draw very " langue of bois " its response to a difficult issue : " eh very ... for say true ... if i am souviens biens to my familiar ." ...
this rend the response perceptive rather than factuelle and is often a drapeau rouge .
it n' there of magique solution for the détection of mensonges , but the development of competences to recognise the tromperie is possible .
these powers amélioreront the opportunities of quiconque d' prevent the victimisation by arnaqueurs in their living professionnelle and interpretation .

the new administration dirigée by l' ancien european commissioner monti must approve a dur paquet d' austérité exigé by the european leaders for récupérer the confidence in italy which had been affectée .

we essayerons to show the best possible , with a great climatic of chansons ; we essayerons d' interpréter two chansons of each album and offer to our fans a répertoire good and another .
you do répétez never the répertoire .
drove is must this ?
i think that c' is partly because we have neuf disques and we can interpréter more of 120 chansons and each aime of chansons various , c' is for this qu' it is very difficult to choisir taking chansons interpréter each soirée .
when we have two or three chansons in the répertoire that we n' have more interprétés since very long awaited , this we aid to leave concentrés and we surprend because this we remind the reasons why we aimions these chansons and that we can be oublié .
this that the show be more interesting for we and therefore i believe qu' it meaning also more interesting for people .

c' is surprenant lorsqu'un mouvement surgit d' a group d' amis and is somewhat up .
time in time , a group surgit d' a towns , but c' is very much more étrange when five or ten groups sortent at the same time the same towns .
we are fiers and c' is a honour for us of former part of the group seattle .
we jouons still with some d' between them time in time .
passée l' year we took a festival with alice in chains and we were in canada with mudhoney , we have seen to soundgarden in their aims , therefore we are chanceux d' be even amis with all them and c' is a honour for us of former part of his seattle which has surgit .
c' is also very étrange qu' a group as your is maintienne uni and with the same states for both time .
yes , four d' between we have been whole course 21 years and matt ( cameron ) we has rejoints there 13 years , and only this is much more time that very groups durent normalement .

we are all amis intimes and through has this there has boulevards musicaux which donnent the freedom to each d' expérimenter .
we have the confidence the sides in the other with the musique of each and this may goes better .

we assurons the fact that we do not passons too time in aims because c' is children of tomber in this jeu of great multitudes and people who aiment ta musique .
if we n' l' oublie not that people are where for the musique , this we are providing to do not responsibility qu' it must comply the musique and which l' has apportée , without is set in top that l' it is célèbre and a rock star , which n' interest not really to air d' between we .
how you souvenez-vous of your other project , mother love bone ?
i believe we have wrote of good chansons and start this has been grandiose .
we have been a group during almost three years and we n' have not submitted a disque before the execution d' andy ( andrew woods ).
there has chipped very frustrations for the fact qu' she has last if little and the most important is the fact that we are still very amis with bruce ( fairweather ) and greg ( gilmore ) which have commencé in the group with we and when j' écoute a chanson or i understand a photo i believe to l' incroyable someone qu' andy was and how i faisait rire , this has always been a plaisir of working , rire , the musique , football and many whilst with him .
it was a person surprenant and we lack .

for changez from you always the paroles of yello ledbetter in investment ?
order is a question for ed ( eddie vedder ), therefore i do not know .
c' is him which the chante and i think qu' it - with the initial paroles qu' it imagine .
as bassiste , taking are its influences ?
there , as ...
among the premiers which i am souviens there geezer butler , john entwistle , c. j. ramone , john paul doe , mccartney , chuck dukowski ...
there as d' influences , that i pourrais discussing any l' après-midi on the bassistes that j' adore .
how has réussi pearl jam has maintaining the relevant grunge in dépit the fact that went n' is more to the method ?
i think we all we sentons a little déconnectés the mot grunge .
when j' in thinking , this remember the groups that i come to mentionner , as mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all those which have surgit at the same time and , if this is relevant now , i believe that this is merveilleux , because c' is a musique which nonetheless worth listening and the groups as mudhoney refuse now the better musique that never .
at the start , its musique had a content more obscur and now in order is devenue more positive .
drove is must this change ?
c' is interesting , because i think qu' there has chansons in the new album which appear more légères , but there is also the chansons , as the end well just breathe qualifiées as chansons very obscures , even if organisation can sonner a little positives .
with the two when ed the has joués for call j' i pleuré when i have the écoutés and organisation are chansons well obscures .
i believe that if tu grandis and there is a traumatisme in ta life and tu perds to a parent or ami , these whilst commencent to influence ton art and ta musique and these chansons , without doubt , this reminiscent to call .
i also think that l' can also be heureux and even as ça l' can do the musique obscure .

and this is precisely a of rares opinion on why coïncident three architectes of barcelone , professeurs universitaires , which s' there are sitting .
roldán miguel , daniel modol and marta bayona : the concours is opportun .
for roldán , make the front littorale " it is necessary to listen " " on the front of montagne " because the speech of ildefons cerda , telecommunications pâtés of maisons vertes n' has not been mené to end .
" we need something the basis that the parc more étendu of barcelona is the plage .
whilst for its great accessibilité .
collserola is more complex ", has given the verdict l' architecte for which the under of " portes of collserola " renferme a " piège lexique ": it must feel to organisation " as the access to a parc , but the délimitation of some areas in why it must act ".
modol , as roldán and bayona with of l' experience in the world urbanistique , qualifie the proposal as " challenge intellectuel " with few périls ". "
of périls which dérivent of " l' incertitude of the projection of l' successful public " after l' vécue experience in the years ' 80 and which has held in the currency zone of the forum " his chant of cygne ".
the first is the peur own délimitation of borders on why l' can build schools .
" limiter accomplished mean establish already the not line ", c' , i.e. his dépassement .
" we feel to new instruments urbanistiques , the planning , because the actuels [ in reference to the general plan métropolitain ( pgm ) ] may boundless of authentiques désastres ".
in that tenant more to the issue , modol opine , that simplifiant , the versant of the area of collserola " el valles can be hear as a parc , barcelona , not ".
modol remind qu' it current already a work done by the patronat of collserola which " must not be perdu ", by thanking for l' appropriateness that the mairie supply to his corporation d' wished in this project " therefore the first time ".
furthermore , it hears that the elections to the montagne with the towns is the sauf-conduit that serves to architectes d' entrer in the debate but " doubt " if this available technical must diriger the équipes multidisciplinaires (" a réussite ", dit-il ) that l' was the create : " we , the architectes , should be just an instrument ".
bayona insinue that the response to the issue which gives the under this pièce is complex , simply because of the concours it lack of vision globale of collserola : " l' was convoqué 16 concours transversaux - dit-il - in the sense montagne-mer , but it n' there not a reading longitudinale which path and comprenne the currency zone in a whole ".
this done , at least in this case , qu' it has opté for participate in the concours 16 .
d' another way , a draft for qu' a of portes such choquer in the programme and définition with that of l' architecte the something voisine .
in his opinion , yes , the mairie to ensure that the bande immédiatement supérieure to to ronda of dalt should predict , in any his extension , a currency zone d' équipements which effectue a douce transition between towns and the vert .
pardonne casino to jonás larrazábal and went will remis in freedom
after 72 jours d' arrestation provisoire , the fondé to be able to légal the casino red has octroyé the pardon on frère the maire of monterrey for the procès initié against him for the prétendus chantages
following 72 past years arrêté , manuel jonás larrazábal will remis in freedom after the fondé at the légal the casino red him octroie the pardon face the second courts pénal the district , which suit a procès for chantage against the frère the maire of monterrey .
after l' attentat the casino royale , the owner the casino red , sergio gil garcía , has submitted a great deal of photos and vidéos in which présumément manuel jonás him exigeait the paiement d' a quotte economic for the maire of monterrey exemptions operation clandestin of the maison of jeu .
after the dénonciation public , the parquet has open a procès pénal against the frère the maire paniste and 2 september went has been arrêté and maintenu in arrestation provisoire during 30 jours .
after four p.m. face l' agent of public prosecutor 3 of délits patrimoniaux , it has been transféré on forms of détention 1 situé in l' ancien quartier of the capitale of l' state .
there is resté during the 49 jours following when l' it has acquitted him a second order of détention after that l' agent of public prosecutor has débouté the délits of corruption and délinquance organisée .
the 19 d' october it has been transféré on relations pénal of cadereyta présumément has not done chanter with a million and a half of pesos the propriétaires the casino red ; but it has past only a few p.m. in the forms of détention of average safety because there were of menaces of execution against him .
him authorities have enabled to allow the procès renfermé in the cellules municipales of san nicolás of los garza .
the 25 october order of capture has been émis by the greffier the second courts pénal the district , jorge yánez , which has said qu' after almost two months d' enquête there were of show confirmées suffisantes for seen the culpabilité of jonás , as amongst stability to l' encaissement of 1,5 million pesos of representatives of the maison of jeu in the key to enable her operation .
this monday , the fondé at the légal the casino red , víctor aldo garcía gómez , s' is created by face the juge josé luis pecina for solliciter the pardon for the frère the maire of the area ; it may therefore récupérer its freedom ' p.m. suivantes .
during the formalités obliged , l' agent of public prosecutor attaché to the courts , ramiro arias , has interrogé garcía gómez if the dommage had been récupéré and which of associés of the maison of jeu had been telecommunications who had octroyé the pardon , but l' avocat has attempted to do not communiquer the behalf .
pursuant to the actual the handling 197 / 2011 l' it octroie the pardon légal to jonás larrazábal and ultérieurement l' able not present no réclamation concerns the procès intenté against him ; l' it him demandera no réparation of dommages and air châtiment not .
after l' audience of fondé at the légal of the maison of jeu , 15 : 50 p.m. l' was ordonné l' immédiate freedom of larrazabal bretón .
the greffier the courts , jorge yánez , s' is déplacé until the prison of municipe of san nicolás of los garza for communiquer to jonás qu' it had been pardonné légalement and his accurate would classé .
it also communiquera him l' order of freedom immédiate that the juge has émis .
the secrétaire dionisio pérez jácome gives communique the details concerning air l' accident in which has perdu life the secrétaire of the government , francisco blake and other seven people
the secrétariat communications and transport ( sct ) has abreast that the basic on l' accident in which has perdu life the secrétaire of government , francisco blake mora and other seven people , indiquent that l' hélicoptère has choqué directly against the sol in complète intégrité structurale , that the pilote such essayer a atterrissage forcé .
during a conference of press , dionisio pérez jácome , secrétaire communications and transport , has referred qu' before the décollage of l' aéronef , the pilote has seen that the conditions of prevails depend adequate to voler .
" the elements which appear indiquer that l' unité has chipped of another contacts with the sol , the pales have held contact with the arbres to 25 mètres where l' unité has perdu the fuselage ".
he has abreast also the fact that unité l' was conçue for 19 people , therefore in order satisfaisait the requirements anything transporter known .
furthermore , it has said that the investigations made in the currency zone d' impacte do not rapportent l' apparition of pièces on sol .
" in research l' was rapporté qu' it n' there of pièces or components of l' aéronef in a other place , l' impact s' is created in structurale .
" l' hélicoptère had been conçu for 19 passagers and satisfaisait the requirements for the transporter .
the sol présentait a pante of seven to 30 different d' inclination .
for the time , the secrétaire has struck qu' a priority is d' be the outcome the more quickly possible ; but l' investigation can durer few months , she even durer a an .
her turn , gilberto lópez meyer , directeur general d' aéroports and services auxiliaires has struck that the time of l' impact , l' hélicoptère of l' etat major présidentiel fonctionnait in vitesse of cruiser and this s' is past on a sol mou ascendant .
" this information supports l' hypothèse d' a operation normale cruiser when the l' impacte ", dit-il .
during the conference of press , the titulaire of the sct , pérez jácome , has énuméré six important elements in l' investigation :
changeover visuel :
according to the normative aéronautique , the changeover has been according to the rules of the changeover visuel , which discussing here does that l' équipage must be the visibilité during the changeover and sol .
conditions météorologiques :
the reports in l' aicm mentionnaient conditions adequate in décollage , and fur and has a position that l' aéronef avançait towards the currency zone limitrophe between df and l' state of mexico there were of layers of nébulosité to modest dealt appropriately .
roads sélectionnées :
it is probable scenario qu " to commend the conditions of nébulosité l' équipage has sought a currency zone of dealt appropriately more limited and more visibilité towards the vallée of cuernavaca .
localisation of l' impacte .
the coordonnées of l' impacte and the final enregistrement of l' aéronef on the radar coïncident , probability before l' impacte it n' there did not have reliable perte to supervise reliable altération of the trajectoire of changeover .
dispersion of restes of l' aéronef in a currency zone réduite :
l' information disponible until now serves to supposer that l' impacte has voted on a trajectoire droite and latérale .
the model of dispersion of restes of l' aéronef serves to supposer that l' hélicoptère s' is heurté against the sol in conditions d' intégrité structurale .
it n' l' has not détecté of traces of feu or d' explosion :
in place of the sinistre l' it n' there is still no trace in the restes of l' aéronef d' a type d' explosion or feu .
the latest results of l' investigation indiquent that l' aéronef had held of multiple contacts with the sol .
during the work of losing l' it has thought of pièces of l' aéronef to dealt appropriately of 9 mille 200 feet on - dessus at the way of the sea , the sol présentait a pente which going since seven dégrées to 30 different d' inclination .
the photographies montrent the séquence in which it s' is possiblement désarticulé in the course of its trajet .
l' information fournit of elements which appear indiquer that l' hélicoptère can be held of impactes multiple with the sol .
after the research minutieuse in a currency zone more ample that l' place encerclé focused on l' accident , l' it n' has not thought of pièces disperses of l' aéronef , which supporte the présomption of that l' impact has voted in conditions d' intégrité structurale .
mss annonce protocole solutions for the gène of l' obésité
the requisite insurance social dirige a investigation for découvrir the gène of l' obésité in the case of enfants and young ; this is supporté by spécialistes the ipn
l' institut mexicain d' requisite insurance social ( imss ) has expected qu' it dirige a investigation for découvrir the gène of l' obésité in the case enfants d' and young people , protocole man ' génétique of l' obésité of enfants and adolescents which permettra d' be the marqueurs associés on surpoids .
in a communiqué , the leader l' unité d' investigation médicale in biochimie of l' hôpital of spécialités the relations médical national the 20 until century , miguel cruz lópez , has expliqué that l' it had formé a équipe multidisciplinaire of médecins , infirmières , nutritionnistes and assistent social .
this équipe is appuyée by spécialistes and étudiants certificate of l' institut national public health ( insp ) and forms d' investigation and d' studies avancées ( cinvestav ) l' institut polytechnique national ( ipn ).
to l' investigation l' it invite to participate the population had or not law , will present to unités sportives participantes the imss to valle of méxico , where s' effectuent the show to mineurs all the samedis something 8 : 00 p.m.
he has pointed out that protocole has commencé in l' unité sportive cuauhtémoc ( estado of méxico poniente ) and qu' with reference to 8 october , l' activity is déroule in l' unité sportive of nezahualcóyolt ( estado of méxico oriente ).
following reached l' objective of réunir 500 or 600 mineurs , l' étude continuera in l' unité sportive independencia ( the south of distrito federal ) surely in l' unité sportive morelos ( the north of distrito federal ).
it has expliqué that l' objective of this investigation and connaitre until the components and l' the importance of génétique concerning development of l' obésité and d' identify among enfants and young people mexicains factors of military for prévenir l' apparition of maladies dégénératives chroniques .
as it célébrera l' the 14 november the mondial item of diabètes , he has referred to that l' objective is that of réunir three mille enfants and young people between six and 14 years , with the consentement and under the surveillance of their parents , for l' application of specific questionnaires relatifs to l' alimentation .
they will also demandés on their physique activity and their antécédents d' hérédité familiale of their maladies , comes to preventing factors of military which déclenchent of affections as the diabète or l' scant rénale .
it has détaillé that the samedis l' it appliquera to all the participants of mesurages anthropométriques ( poids , scale , circonférence of the scale ), pushes artérielle , détermination of average glucose , triglycérides , cholestérol and insuline and génétiques ( l' it cherche to identify the people associés to l' obésité infantile ).
cruz lópez has indicated that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of professionnels of health for l' alarmante taken to in the case of mineurs .
the enquêtes ' health of 1999 and 2000-2006 have indicated that in just six years there held a hausse , in the case of garçons , 77 for cent in obésité and in the case of the filles 47 for cent ; the surpoids l' was observé also a hausse dramatique' , souligna the spécialiste the imss .
it has indiqué that the justification for research of marqueurs is basée in the fact that the population of countries is different of other by his histoire génétique .
he has abreast qu' average , the mexicains have a 65 for cent d' hérédité indo-américaine , a 30 for european cent and a five for cent africaine and this condition reflected in the people associés on diabètes and surpoids .
it has expliqué qu' in general , the génétique of l' obésité take the form in l' incapacité of bruler l' excès d' energy that l' it consume ( calories ), which dépose in the form of graisse .
the chercheur has expliqué that the good directe for the participants c' is l' assessment intégrale of enfants , which serves to détecter s' they unnecessarily a degree of surpoids or d' obésité .
ila even said that the présence of plis of couleur sombre ( acanthosis ) on the cou and l' avant-bras indiquent the probabilité of souffrir of compromising métaboliques and even pré-diabètes .
l' information is gérée d' a way confidentielle , the médecins the remettent by wrote to parents , which l' it explique each of measures and changes in the style of life qu' they must réaliser for prévenir the maladies .
cruz lópez has expliqué qu' there has three components principaux which causent surpoids , obésité and d' other affections chroniques : the sédentarisme , which is the lack physique d' activity everyday , leave the majority of the journée assis towards télé and draw of levels of transport in place d' goes to pied on of distances courtes .
another case is the largest high calorique , i.e. the consumer c' more of boissons sucrées , hydrates of carbone ( tamales - pâté of viande to the farine of maïs enveloppé in feuilles of maïs -, pain , pizza , hamburgers , etc. .) with a high content of graisses and protéines and the génétique analysée in this protocole .
asphalte l' of l' unam éviterait the cassis
rafael herrera , chercheur of the faculté of chimie of l' unam , développe of asphaltes modifiés with of polymères for produire a mélange with a best return , indépendamment conditions environnementales and imagine
if the signales that the pavé depend résolues , it would more necessary to repair environ 200 mille cassis each saison of pluie in the métropolitaine currency zone of valle of méxico , avertit rafael nájera herrera , chercheur of the faculté of chimie ( fq ) of the unam , which has struck that if the process of construction and entretien the pavé bitumineux is adéquat , the cassis pourraient be réduits or even éliminés complètement .
during its conference a technological opinion on the cassis , organisée in the context of the chimie l' year speculation , he has expected that the laboratoire which it is responsible développe of asphaltes modifiés with of polymères for produire a mélange had of caractéristiques similaires to those of l' asphalte , but with a mécanique frost-resistance more , both to hautes as of basses températures .
nájera herrera has estimé that this type asphaltes d' modifiés may be utilisé in endroits in which the prevails is extremely hot , as some cities of the north of the countries , to improving the return , and therefore , the training of cassis .
it has expliqué that l' asphalte , the more lourde the pétrole , is a whole molécules of hydrocarbures , molécules with a poids moléculaire more lourd , appelées asphaltènes , and molécules with a poids moléculaire bas , appelées malthènes , which all donnent on pavé his caractéristique comportement viscoélastique .
the comportement viscoélastique of l' asphalte consiste in the fact qu' to températures hautes , closely to 180 different , will comporte as a liquide , 120 different c its viscosité is very great and 50 different c it currently stands a state almost sound , during qu' to températures very basses , l' asphalte meaning cassant , ajouta-t-il .
this means that in rues the frost-resistance of l' asphalte n' is not uniforme and is modifie during the item in civil conditions environnementales and imagine , avertit the spécialiste in ingénierie chimique .
the chercheur of the fq has observé that the rues of ciudad of méxico in their majority depend covered by a pavé flexible , composé of six layers of matériaux , whose three last impliquent l' asphalte .
between layers more superficielles is trouve the couche d' asphalte , formée by of small pierres baignées in asphalte and compactées ultérieurement .
each of small pierres which forme the couche , signalât-il , is baignée an asphalte .
when the tankers there passent in générant efforts , went serves that surveys is propagent very in the pavé .
if we had to asphalte l' l' amended , organisation is propageraient better , opinât l' ingénier chimique .
on the couche d' asphalte , dit-il , l' it met a last couche appelée couche of roulement , faite in pierre fine , i.e. c' , the sable which is also baigné in asphalte .
as in order is the couche in contact with the roues of tankers , it must be more power mécanique that the couche d' asphalte and providing of l' adhérence in the rue .
being the case the part of the pavé which reçoit and distribue the efforts , the couche of roulement cofinancing also that order has a épaisseur adéquate and the matériau which it is faite must be soigné .
the prevails , spécialement l' humidité and variations of imagine , are also a facteur very important to regard , spécialement l' water , dit-il , because our citizens affectent considérablement the return of the couche d' asphalte .
when the sol is mouille , l' water is répand to internal l' of the couche is c' is so difficult that order , which ramollie all layers of pavé and therefore commend of cassis .
in the procès of training d' a cassis , dit-il , the first which gâche is the pellicule of roulement and only ultérieurement is affectée the couche d' asphalte , but the dommage n' has not place immédiatement , but c' is a process which must be soigné to premiers signaux with the programmes d' entretien adéquats .
the membre of the system of national chercheurs has expliqué that the employees of tankers is a facteur other important for the training of cassis and therefore l' épaisseur of each couche the pavé must be always linked to the employees of tankers and ensure its satisfied , in order to prevent the training fréquente of cassis .
rafael herrera has averti qu' there is still much to investiguer and working on l' asphalte , for example , the émulsions bitumineuses , which in d' other countries already exist on the market and head of repair cassis facilement and without moral spent of hautes températures .
qu' has manqué to the candidate of valle for the new miss colombie ?
analysis factors which have done that melina ramírez serna n' obtienne not the couronne of miss colombie .
reçoit valle his under numéro 14 of princesse .
again del valle cauca is resté with the désir of gagner the couronne of miss colombie .
this fois-ci melina ramírez serna , is content ourselves with the fact of is strike on the podium of gagnantes , brought up the couronne d' money and the bande which l' accrédite as new princesse of colombie .
today the great question that very world is is :
qu' est-ce qu' it has manqué ? because the result represent the défaite d' a great favorite in each presentation has démontré qu' it l' had any for the new miss colombie , because it n' had not been élue in vain reine the police and best visage jolie of vogue , titres established by the reines taliana vargas or natalia navarro which s' have emporté the couronne of miss colombie .
the first key facteur considered in the decision taken by the juré of the désigner first princesse is the fact qu' it n' has not absolutely certain with its response to the issue "? quel has been the white which t' has characterised and why ? posée by martín murillo gómez , the carreta literaria leamos .
these the response of the candidate of valle to this question :
" i lis very much , i think quite in the littérature , i believe that c' is a forme of is culturaliser , définitivement i think the white which has characterised my enfance is " the small step prince ", c' is a white profond quite .
now i lis " crime and châtiment ", c' is a white of littérature universelle that we should reading all ; and now i lis the white irene d' nemirovski , a russe , a white very beau which s' next " l' passionately the sang "".
this n' response has not just plait d' firstly to commend the term " is culturaliser " and secondly to do not explain specifically of what way each white quoted l' had marquée .
but at the end of the cérémonie melina has declared qu' it sentait tranquille and heureuse with the result " l' univers and sage , it is happening which is passer .
and for everyone , please read s' it you plaît a little , " the small step prince " is a great white "
between the hypothèses lancées there amongst does valle has been destroyed by the favoritisme .
a journaliste of bogota has insinué that being the case , the préférée , the ovationnée and the candidate who recevait all the prices préliminaires ( challenge of gastronomie oster , the vote of public for the best costume artisanal , and reine mère ), " this has réveillé the jalousie of other candidates , has stressé the reine and c' is for this qu' it n' has not brillé on the scène ".
and l' it has taken note this in its first presentation in maillot of bain to the plage of hilton and its two défilés of the day of the couronnement .
even if the two défilés it had paru safe d' it even , l' it has taken note qu' it n' had not the power and l' energy of représentantes of magdalena and atlántico .
ariel osorio , journaliste programme " como in casa " ( as to the maison ), the rcn canal has declared that the fact that melina eut been désignée princesse " confirme that the candidate who obtient most of the prices during the concours do not reçoit the couronne of reine ".
furthermore , valle has évité the press to the end , and this has been a mistake .
another hypothèse c' is that valle n' has not réussi to convaincre the jury on his interest for the initiatives social , which is in fact l' essence of the concours national of beauté .
c' is for this that two jours before l' elected the jurée speculation lucy doughty has declared qu' they cherchaient a femme engaged in the nécessités social of his countries .
" only the beauté n' is not sufficient here a miss colombie , we must regarder on - delà the physique and s' axer on its sensibilité social , qu' before start the concours are already impliquées in projects ", expliqua-t-elle .
it spécule l' also that valle has sin by its défauts of his derrière and the fibrose which s' observait in his abdomen , but this is contradictoire , specifically the jury l' has élu as the candidate ' beauté naturelle with the until more sain , good alimentation and work physique responsible .
the préparateur of reines jorge hernán orozco reconnait that melina n' had not the best until , qu' it in there had better , " but his problem fibrose on l' abdomen , which , in fact , to call n' had not been too notoire , combat has quitté points the final ". item
entre-temps the journaliste guido hoyos , of the review cromos regarded as l' mistake of the candidate of valle have been the interventions chirurgicales qu' it had subi .
" the chirurgies are good , but valle n' has not su the do .
his until n' has never been his atout and she has perdu to commend this deal ".
for this prices , that the concours national of beauté remet for the first time , the défilé in maillot of bain has surgit a cruelle prédiction which s' is done night , l' it disait that this was a small step cadeau that raymundo faisait to melina for do not give him the goût of the couronne .
ensure or not , the truth is that melina commence today a year of règne , not as souveraine , otherwise as princesse , a position which him the chance of représenter colombie in one of the concours internationaux by désignation the concours national .
however , it passera in l' histoire as an of reines which dépit of his éblouissant systematic by cartagena , n' has not approved the couronne .
well has been the work of the someone of cali which has identifié the cadavre d' alfonso cano
a dactyloscopiste of cali is past to l' histoire as l' homme which has confirmé the execution d' " alfonso cano' .
the work of these officials is crucial .
the past 4 november a dactyloscopiste the cti of cali has past to l' histoire as the someone who has confirmé l' identité the leader suprême of farc : " alfonso cano ", in confrontant its empreintes digitales .
of seven dactyloscopistes which travaillent in the local bureaux the cti , this week c' was turn of " openness of eliazar gonzález , a of puerto tejada which works since 21 years in the field judiciaire d' investigation .
the start of its carrière , gonzález has travaillé in the municipes of chocó , where very time it , passer more five jours in the forêt to achieve l' place in which is trouvaient the cadavres qu devaient be identifiés .
l' 2000 it s' is done transféré to the capitale of valle and following suit of during adéquats , it s' is spécialisé in dactyloscopie , which is étude l' of the peau of c' friction , i.e. the paumes and feet .
during the week of l' opération against alias alfonso cano it had averti to eliazar of take with him of habits at least for three jours .
accomplished of very great l' expected .
friday the dawn it is party for cauca in a hélicoptère of palmira .
it savait qu' it adhere to identify two cadavres and that it suspectait l' qu' a d' them was that of l' homme which dirigeait the guérrilla more east of society , therefore it him has requested of s' emporter the counted with the ten empreintes digitales of guillermo león sáenz ( his true behalf ).
but lorsqu'il is arrivé with l' équipe d' investigation to l' place the cadavre can l' has not reconnu by his deal physique , was very différent of telecommunications qu' it had seen in the média .
it n' had no barbe , it was habillé as a paysan of the currency zone , without lunettes and many more maigre .
but the empreintes do not mentent .
accompagné by a loupe galtonienne , l' encre , a préleveur and a lanterne , eliazar has comparé the empreintes digitales the cadavre with those of the counted .
his œil do l' has not trompé : it s' agissait d' " alfonso cano ".
this same dawn , l' homme originaire of puerto tejada has been the responsible which has confirmé on secretary of defending , juan carlos pinzón that yes , it s' agissait the leader suprême of farc .
for research of l' empreinte
for a dactyloscopiste of sijín of cali the acknowledgement that the president juan manuel santos has done to eliazar gonzález , in a conference of press for l' opération against " cano ", is very significatif .
a lot of people of connait not our work .
the dactyloscopie is a exacte science , without outside d' mistake , which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes .
to hand d' identify the cadavres , the dactyloscopistes appuient the investigations for the délits as the changeover and l' homicide and confirment l' identité people capturées .
when are capturées , many of délinquants totally disregards the cartes d' identité fausses or n' have not of documents .
we make their empreintes digitales and cherchons in the basis of data .
the chercheur has conté that in a case of changeover it , enlever a part of mur d' a maison , because in this place the voleur had appuyé its hand to ensure sortir a coffre-fort plein of bijoux and l' money .
" the murs are hard because they are not of superficies adequate to in a empreinte might digitale , but in this case we have been get l' empreinte of any hand and identify at délinquant who had took to various vols ", is souvient-il .
the empreintes may also to eliminate or confirmer of suspects in case d' homicide .
much l' it has thought a homme execution , with the bouteilles of boisson focused on him .
by intermède of l' investigation l' was déterminé qu' a parent can be suspect of crime and has a empreinte on the bouteille coïncidait .
even if this garantit no not qu' it be l' assassin , this the place on the scène the crime .
a dactyloscopiste the cti has expliqué that l' it extrait " the empreintes digitales of objets with of réactifs chimiques or physiques ".
apparaissent place , l' it utilise a préleveur or a bande for the prélever .
postérieurement , the empreintes are envoyées to asif , the basis of data of déclinquents or the register civil national .
" the problem is qu' there is still very colombiens without papiers ", indiqua l' expert the cti .
it has expliqué that everything n' is not how l' it shows in the programme of television csi .
as everything brille n' is not d' well , all that l' it concerns do not forcement meaning a empreinte .
it can but be utilisée , if it réalise l' the confrontation necessary .
the " indignés " défient authorities to new york
of centaines of manifestants is bousculaient towards place zuccotti for there camper .
a great part of people have accédé to l' agenda d' évacuation and s' is déplacé to a parc voisin .
the intégrants the mouvement representing wall street have défié this tuesday authorities of new york in essayant d' entrer again , through the order judiciaire , to the place of manhattan , d' where they have been évacués to l' dawn and place have attempted d' focus a other parc of the great pomme .
of centaines of manifestants is bousculaient towards place zuccotti , where they voulaient accéder through the order judiciaire which serves to ' indignés of camper again in this place , during that l' secondly of mouvement previously to l' évacuation in occupant a parc more in the north of the quoted , where there has chipped new arrêts .
" our idea is that if the courts do we not serves to camper again in place , we shall we installer in a other place and we continuerons the fight légale for retourner to zuccotti , and travers of sit-ins and manifestations pacifiques ", dit-un of porte-paroles the mouvement " representing wall street ", mark bray .
bray has détaillé that the response of ' indignés to l' évacuation of their personal camp dicté by the maire of new york , michael bloomberg , is arrivé jusqu'aux courts , where the juge lucy billings has émis order which interdisait l' évacuation forcée of l' place and permettait to manifestants of clearly in the camp .
furthermore , ' indignés have consistently shown a new parc situé to the confluence of centrales canal street and the sixth avenue , very proche of l' entry to the tauern holland , which unit new york and new jersey , ownership of the paroisse trinity church .

the cdu proposes d' élire president european on suffrage universel
the first journée the congrès of l' union chrétienne-démocrate ( cdu ), monday 14 november , to leipzig , s' is déroulée without carefully difficulté for angela merkel , chancelière but also president of the party chrétien-démocrate .
l' future of l' europe n' was not initialement exceptional on programme but s' is imposé to l' automne , particularly for meet the militants which jugent policy of the government too laxiste with regard to the grecs today and perhaps of italiens tomorrow .
the point on the presidency of the european commission , proposed by the directorate , has been adopted the quasi-unanimité .
on 1001 délégués , investment neuf have voted against and ten have declared abstenus .
the standing ovation of several minutes to which have held law , to l' close of their interventions , angela merkel then , few p.m. later , wolfgang schäuble , the very europhile secretary of finances , laissait not place in the doubt .
idée-maîtresse l' of the chancelière - and the point - impression in a slogan : the response to the crise " n' is not least d' europe but more d' europe ".
not only because l' europe , c' is the paix but because " d' neuf million jobs dépendent directly of l' euro ".
for the chancelière , " the time is come d' a percée in europe ".
this may is put by amendments to the treaty of lisbonne enable guarantee supervision of l' european union on the budgetary policies of countries of the euro currency zone , but this may also déboucher on l' elected the president of the european commission in universel suffrage so as to give a visage to l' europe ".
follow-up is in any event l' a proposals of the point adopted by the congrès which l' inspirateur is clearly wolfgang schäuble .
though , it is somewhat probable scenario that the vingt-sept s' accordent rapidly on this révolution : the grande-bretagne is hostile and the leaders of the croient cdu know that nicolas sarkozy l' is also .
but the jalon is posé .
the délégués have rejeté to écrasante majority the proposal of pondérer the poids of each countries in directoire of the banque central european civil the poids of each economy , which of course revenait to guarantee the poids of l' germany .
soucieuse d' apaiser the prevails to internal l' of his party , the chancelière has multiplié the références to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl but it n' has not not sought to gagner his congrès at the expense of " petits " european countries or countries in difficulté prompts to criticise l' arrogante germany .
if the point on l' europe consacre a paragraph to l' importance of " l' amitié franco-allemande ", angela merkel n' has not mentioned france .
in creux exception .
in rappelant qu' there has two siècles , leipzig had been the cœur d' a sanglante bataille .
of done , meticulous l' a of humiliantes défaites of l' american napoléonienne .
that represent the fraude to arrêts maladie ?
after the allocations , l' ump and the government lancent l' supporting on the arrêts maladie .
nicolas sarkozy will tuesday 15 november in bordeaux for visiter a caisse d' allocations familiales , and prononcer a speech on the issue - récurrent since 2007 - the fight against the fraudes and l' assistanat .
and to support this supporting , which hand d' a willingness to of economies in a ways of rigueur , but n' is not less annonciatrice d' a axe of areas présidentielle to droite , the majority wishes is focus on the arrêts maladie .
firstly d' in a approving d' economies budgetary : the government envisage d' imposer to salariés the private a fourth off of carence before the slow in employees d' a arrêt of work .
in clear , without agree d' specific business , a wage earner which tombe ill perdrait four jours of salaire , therefore at least 15% of his revenu mensuel .
a position which military of susciter of the colère , but which would make it possible to rapporter 280 million d' eur , according to the echos .
and which would accompagnée d' another ready , made more symbolique : imposer to officials a day of carence not indemnisée in case d' arrêt of work ( they n' have hitherto no period of carence , against three jours in the private ).
considering that these issues are , in consideration , the majority revitalise also the issue of fraudes , ciblant this time the framework in relation to arrêts of work .
" the contrôles seem to be very much more important and , more , if you êtes taken , you rembourserez ", has averti xavier bertrand on micro of rtl , dimanche 13 november .
as for d' other cases , the effects annonce d' appear rather disproportionnés with the fact of fraudes to arrêts of work .
order done word l' decide since seven-year d' a follow-up constant and d' offensives policies which have the more often porté their fruits .
the french not more malades qu' indeed in europe .
we attardons d' firstly on the uk national .
according to the caisse nationale d' requisite insurance maladie ( cnam ), more 237 million d' eur d' indemnités journalières have been délivrés in 2000-2006 .
according to l' institut of research and documentation in the economy of health , the indemnités journalières représentaient in 2008 5% the spending of health , with 11,3 d' billion .
on this somme , 46% the congés maternité and accidents work , and 54% the arrêts maladie , be 6,2 d' billion .
and therefore 2,5% the spending of health .
in 2010 the french have connu average 14,5 jours d' arrêt of work , against 17,8 in 2009 according to a étude the group alma consulting .
a average which cache the some : another enquête , publiée in 2007 by the site of management of carrière monster . com , montrait that 75% of 40 000 salariés french interrogés disaient n' be taken off without d' arrêt maladie .
another étude , this time of l' requisite insurance maladie , says qu' in 2010 37% of arrêts maladie d' delivered a durée inférieure to 8 jours , 22% of 8 to 14 jours , 15% of 15 jours to a months , 15% of a to three months and 11% on - delà .
when we compare the with their european voisins , the french salariés are not more enclins qu' indeed to arrêts of work .
a youth étude undertaken in 2010 by two chercheurs the cnrs montrait qu' between 1994 and 2001 the catastrophic d' lack globale ( for reasons of health or not ) oscillait , france , between 10% and 11% , against 20% and 28% on danemark , 15% in the united kingdom or 16% and 18% the netherlands .
the fraude to arrêts maladie represent very little such work on noir .
to comment fraude , it n' reached qu' modest scale .
the strengthening of legislation since seven-year that the contrôles are systématiques on the arrêts maladie of more 45 jours .
in 2008 on 1,5 million of contrôles , the cnam has seen 13% of 285 000 made for the arrêts of transition durée depend " injustifiés or too longs ", be 37 050 case .
in the case of arrêts of more jours 45 , systématiquement contrôlés , it comptait 11% these " inadaptés or injustifiés " on approximately 1.2 million , be 132 000.
the total , therefore 169 000 case " injustifiés ", on several million of salariés had held a arrêt maladie .
a chiffre which represent very little such , for example , to the first work on noir .
according to the ump member dominique tian , author d' a report on the question représenterait 9 june , went to eur 15 billion d' of lack to gagner fiscal by an , be more that the total costs of indemnités journalières , and therefore infiniment more that the fraude to these last .

énergétique policy :
the facts must l' emporter on the dogmes
s' it is a matter that can traiter l' something considérations of short term or under the coup of l " feeling , c' is the énergétique policy .
the openness and the costs l " électricité influent directly on the order d' achat and on the competitiveness of enterprises .
it is sain qu' a rendez-vous électoral be l' the opportunity to reflect to such enjeux and the place qu' there impression the nucléaire .
the debate will not successful that s' it explore l' all the consequences economic , social and environnementales of options proposées .
the french must fonder their opinion on facts objectives , of data rationnelles .
considering that we are 7 billion d " êtres human on the planète , l " development démographique entraînera a doublement the request d " électricité d' here to 2050 to less priver a énorme part of the population mondiale d' a élément vital .
at the same time , we pallier the raréfaction of resources fossiles for allow to produire of l " électricité in permanence , without responsibility l' impérieuse need to reduce the émissions of gaz to word of serre for combat the dérèglement diversity , a matter disparu the debate écologique .
l' accident of fukushima do modifie air of these paramètres .
that is why c' l' germany demeure isolée in its decision of renoncer on nucléaire .
this is the case n' reliable the belgium , which soumet the sienne the need to be able to strike a accord of remplacement able take over , reliable of the suisse , which hears juste do more build schools that centrales of last génération .
has l' inverse , the grande-bretagne , the finlande , the pologne , the federal tchèque , the netherlands , the afrique l' sweden , the south , the chine , l' inde , the brazil , not citer qu' them , poursuivent their projects with détermination .
the etats-unis , them , have décidé after fukushima d' addition a unité to their parc in the construction d' a central adjourned after l' accident of three mile island .
if the german model , axé to renewable energies , is sometimes before as one example , the fact contrarie the speech .
the offer of berlin is going to put by the renchérissement the prices of l " électricité , a dépendance énergétique aggravée by the recours accru on gaz importé , particularly of russia , a bond of émissions of co 2 entraîné by the construction of centrales on gaz and charbon .
in a few months , l' whole of these fâcheux effects will refuse already ressentir .
the case of danemark is to méditer .
champion d' europe of l " éolien , which it presents 30% of his électricité , it is also l' one of the worst utilisateurs more of charbon and gaz the fact of the intermittence l' vent ; pursuant to the actual from , its émissions of co 2 and the prices of his électricité are respectivement 65% and 50% more high that the european average .
has l' inverse , through to the constance of our policy énergétique , our voisins acquittent a facture d " électricité supérieure of 40% to exercises ménages french .
considering that in a mondialisée economy the costs l " energy endlessly a key facteur of competitiveness and a gage the maintaining l' tool industriel on the national territory , companies france benefit of l " électricité the less chère d' europe .
of this fact , any significant reduction from the nucléaire engendrerait a forte hausse the prices of l " électricité , which rendrait illusoires the belles appeared on the réindustrialisation of our countries and defending the at d' achat .
a prices qu' a vast majority of french is refusent to payer , d' world qu' they do not manifestent d' opposition to principle to this energy , the sondages the montrent .
rappelons policy énergétique of our countries has enabled to build a filière industrial of 125 000 jobs directs and 410 000 jobs induits .
encouraging exportatrice , it does a galaxie of smes spécialisées on the markets internationaux and rend very créatrices d' jobs not délocalisables .
if france venait to décider of sortir the nucléaire , this would sacrifier right number of these smes réduisant as peau of chagrin the eur 6 billion d' annual d' exportations france d " équipements and services nucléaires .
quel électricien commanderait a epr conçu for function soixante years considering that the déclin of his fabricant would programmé ?
for solving l " perspective énergétique , we must admettre qu' it n' current no accord of production d " électricité miracle , not more qu' it n' in addition to diabolique .
the development by areva of solutions little émettrices of co 2, nucléaires and energies , témoigne of the complémentarité sources of energy d " .
for the nucléaire , maintaining as safe as sûreté is a impératif absolute .
we have in france a competent of sûreté which exerce a supervision intransigeant and transparent on the centrales exist as on the chantier of flamanville .
our équipes , which the professionnalisme is reconnu , are habitées of the same obsession of sûreté .
in a demi-siècle , l' industry nucléaire has connu three accidents lived .
a only , three mile island , is intervenu in conditions d' exploitation normale ; it is resté without result human reliable environmental .
has tchernobyl , the attitude of the réacteur and fautes human impardonnables have led the drame .
has fukushima , some appear responsibility that l' accident résulte two natural disasters d' a scale without previous which have causé the execution of dizaines of thousands of people .
l' industry nucléaire tirera the enseignements of this accident , as it l' had done for the two précédents .
fruit of this approach and d' a cooperation between the authorities of sûreté , the exploitants and the french constructeurs and allemands , l' epr who a attitude the rendant able résister to such phénomènes .
considering qu' it is considered by all the électriciens désireux to build schools a central , l' arrêt its construction to flamanville would be a magnificent cadeau offert to concurrents d' areva and edf in their laissant the way free for s' emparer the leadership in l' incontournable development nucléaire .
it is essential légitime and of rechercher the best bouquet énergétique for our countries , but it would irresponsable of laisser l " feeling , the dogmes and manœuvres partisanes dominer a debate also déterminant for the situation economic , social and financial of our countries .
l' immigration est-elle a employees or an for l' economy ?
the policy on immigration d' undertaken under nicolas sarkozy has been critiquée under another differently - engorgement services policiers , judiciaires and transparent having to the policy of the chiffre , compatibilité of this policy with the statut autoproclamé of " countries the right of l' homme " of france .
more much , c' is the harcèlement administratif which refuse l' decide the étudiants étrangers which has done l' proved , the secretary of internal l' ( reading him of 23 may ) proclamant on systematic that france " n' has not needs talents étrangers , maçons and serveurs of restaurant ".
but it n' is that rarement analysée under l' view .
c' is qu' there on this issue a quite widest consensus between gauche and droite .
has droite , the ton has been granted by jacques chirac which stated in 1976 that " 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a countries include closely of 2 million of workers immigrés ", and gauche , by michel rocard expliquant that france " can not accueillir any the misère of the world " in 1990.
the only différence , the degree of générosité
in 2005 the peur of l' invasion of the territory national by hordes of plombiers polonais was partagée to gauche as to droite .
for the two bords , the immigrants are perçus as an employees for l' economy and society coup .
the only différence impression at degree of générosité that l' it daignera give regard to the immigrés .
in its programme , françois hollande is cantonne to banalités , indiquant that the codéveloppement permettra solving our problem migratoire ". "
this idea of l' immigration as an employees , a problem , is probably payante électoralement ; but it is économiquement very cost-intensive .
as the rappellent the économistes ian goldin and geoffrey cameron in a récent ouvrage synthétisant the connaissances the most récentes on l' immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our managed , may 2011 princeton university press , 352 pp .), it current a widest consensus among the spécialistes on l' positive impact of uncontrolled migratoires on the economic growth , the salaires and l' employment in the countries which reçoivent of immigrants .
restreindre l' immigration anémie growth and dawn to l' employment .
the craintes to l' impact of migrants are fondées on l' idea that our citizens risquent of take over from national workers , particularly the little qualifiés , exerçant a pushes lowering on their salaires .
but l' experience shows that , in fact , the immigrants are very much more complémentaires that substituts to salariés national exerçant for l' share of métiers in sectors in shortage d' employment .
the immigrants little qualifiés travaillent in sectors which n' attirent not the national salariés , and more qualifiés in sectors grow in which the training do not suit l' supply d' jobs .
a word on the salaires positive
in the same way qu' a chirurgien will take the mal to working in a countries which aware of a shortage d' anesthésistes , these complémentarités between national and migrants are the arrivées d' immigrants have a positive down on the salaires and l' employment of national .
peri giovanni has well calculé qu' a hausse of 1% of uncontrolled migratoires does an increasing comprise between 0,6 and 0,9% of salaires réels to the long term .
and this without take into account the fact that the diversity apportée by the immigrants contribution to the creation of d' produce and the economic growth ( forte proportion d' immigrants naturalisés among the prices nobel américains ; google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo have been fondées by immigrants ).
the migrants are also contributeurs nets systems of social average to dealt appropriately of 1% the total budget in european countries .
l' organisation mondiale work considers example that in germany , a immigrant here to l' âge of 30 years apportera a contribution perfectly ( recettes less spending ) of eur 150000 to public budgets average on l' whole life .
nicolas sarkozy souhaitait , start of mandate , goes seek the points of growth manquants " with the dents ".
the dents in question , used to dissuader the immigrants , have held l' exact down inverse .
l' europe has inventé the démocratie , still feel the european démocratie
the démocratie is a very valuable ; c' is also a very fragile .
the european build should be able s' in vivid him which l' be inventée to athènes there than two mille years , has connu in the course of the century xxe the tragédies of the great guerre , totalitarismes , l' holocauste , the goulag , but also franco in espagne , salazar on portugal , the colonels in greece .
some have been belief qu' it suffirait , for the démocratie triomphât définitivement of its ennemis , d' exercer the vote , and exercer l' the way the more directe that .
we all know , since napoléon " the small step ", qu' it s' agissait where d' a facilité of thinking here .
the universel suffrage to be the condition necessary to the démocratie , n' is not the condition sufficient and can even will do instrument " d' oppression " as disait autrefois the philosophe républicain etienne vacherot .
not , the démocratie requiert more : a successful public , a public spirit , valeurs , a organisation , a séparation and a supervision of authorities , a éducation , lumières , solidarités economic and social , a justice .
the crise of l' europe that we vivons is a crise economic , but it is enforcement and d' firstly a crise the policy and the démocratie .
the palinodie the vrai-faux référendum grec will held in this connection value of double révélateur : that of the need retour d' a puissant the policy , but also that of the opinion troublant of his impossibilité , on his incongruité .
this ambivalence must be thinking here to be dépassée .
the truth is that of the of front of combat démocratique is are today déplacées , and that , for many d' between them , the soldats républicains do tirent more in the proper directorate .
we n' have nothing to gagner to demand a succession of national référendums , organisés on if of nécessités and in order populations .
a blanc-seing on european monarque absolute or a saut to feet joints in the vide the repli nationaliste : quel offer benefit !
not , we do not want to couperets but exercise , together , plein law , serein and continu , offer and the démocratie , this time at european level .
it n' there of crises in greece , italy , espagne , portugal - not saurait d' indeed more where arrêter l " énumération - because it n' there qu' a crise , and it is in europe .
c' is l' europe entière everything which plie to diktats of markets and agences of notation , which pâtit of his impuissance and his transparent of solidarité .
c' is l' europe all entière which is humiliée on the scène speculation .
it s' inquiète of transferts of souveraineté towards l' europe - but c' is l' europe entière everything which perd doucement its souveraineté , and with it each of its united nations .
l' urgent , c' is of redonner to the souveraineté populaire the pilotage of the european project .
because c' is whole , that the european pourront reduce the poids of their dettes , will libérer of markets and préparer l' future in investissant .
the enforceable of crise supposera decisions at european level can not be taken without a legitimacy démocratique totale , exception course to we conduire on désastre .
following long awaited combattu this proposal socialist and jacques delors , everyone réclame today the european economic government .
be .
but the feel without a political integration and démocratique more forte , and vécue as such by citizens , it would be a new folie and a new impasse .
we need assumer a new étape of the european construction .
to ensure the federal in france , it has fallu " do " of républicains .
the révolution in the interests could not there suffire .
this basic still valable .
we need build schools , a europe more integrated on the economic terms .
this is able to qu' in construisant a europe more démocratique on the plan policy , a genuine european souveraineté populaire .
to ensure l' europe , doing of european .

the sahara on nigeria , the front terroriste s' étend
paris s' inquiète of the links between al-qaida in the maghreb islamique and the secte boko haram .
soupçonnés youth date , the links between the group terroriste al-qaida in the maghreb islamique ( aqmi ) and the secte nigériane boko haram is confirment .
dimanche , the vice-ministre algérien of affaires étrangères , abdelkader messahel , even affirmé qu' alger in has submitting " acquis the certitude ".
" developments in the two organisations opèrent and the reports of services of renseignement montrent qu' although there are now ", cooperation expliqué without any more specific .
paris seems to an analysis similaire .
enquête l' on the rapt two french on niger in january last might put on item of passerelles .
kidnappés in a restaurant of niamey by proches d' aqmi , antoine of léocour and vincent delory devaient be tués the lendemain at the same time that several of their ravisseurs during d' a opération afternoon by surveys spéciales france .
in the décombres of l' intervention , the french enquêteurs and nigériens devaient find ourselves several puces téléphoniques appartenant to terroristes .
terroriste axe
l' analysis of appels passés oriente towards several interlocuteurs small-scale revenue-based on mali , on niger and nigeria .
according to radio france speculation ( rfi ), two numéros intéressent particularly the enquêteurs : l' a to pursue a nigérien which has séjourné longuement to maiduguri , a towns the north of nigeria , berceau of boko haram and l' other to a homme which said proche d' aqmi and the secte .
" c' is a claims but it must without doubt attendre of show more formelles before discussing of opérationnelle cooperation between aqmi and boko haram ".
" but c' is possible ".
" we all know since the years that the secte experiencing d' appuis financial and intellectuels extérieurs and qu' it shows more and more active ", tempère kunle amuwo , a chercheur nigérian .
these latest months these " appuis " had been more and more évidents in l' development and of speech of boko haram or in its types opératoires , which impliquent submitting the recours to kamikazes or to engins explosifs more and more complexes and even facture that those used by aqmi .
the community speculation , to start by washington , has therefore pushes abuja for qu' it takes into account the problems posés by boko haram .
nigérianes authorities have word long awaited considered the group as an community d' illuminés little dignes d' interest .
a success rapid
fondée in seven-year to maiduguri focused d' a mosquée , d' a école and l' iman fondamentaliste mohammed yusuf , boko haram - which will mean haoussa " l' éducation occidentale is a sin " - prône l' instauration d' a émirat islamique in the north of the musulman nigeria .
in this area pauvre , l' association aware a success rapid .
it politise and cofinancing a strict compliance with the charia tandis that its militants engagent the fight against the fundamental impie government .
these latest relate d' firstly the églises , the bars , administrations .
in 2009 the militants of boko haram is montrent particularly actifs , multipliant the attaques against the commissariats .
the réaction d' abuja is , as to its habitude , without nuances .
l' american investit towns , we account 800 violent .
mohammed yusuf , arrêté vivant , is tué in prison .
consequently the secte going to take radicaliser and quitter its fiefs of the north .
to noël final , it revendique a attentat which have 80 violent to jos , then a other to abuja .
in june , c' is still to abuja that boko haram s' takes the qg sécurisé the police in d' a attaque suicide , its first .
in août , the siège operators of united nations expeditiously will its first cible speculation .
the creation of a terroriste d' axe in afrique which naviguerait of the mauritanie to the somalie in passant by the nigeria inquiète submitting all the spécialistes of safety .
considering qu' aqmi has investi the mali and the niger , that the somaliens d' al-chebab opèrent on kenya , boko haram clearly as an new menace on the cœur build .
the last week , during d' a entretien on nigeria with the president goodluck jonathan , alain juppé has put in careful against boko haram and s' is said prêt " to partager all the renseignements " .
everyone according to the républicains acceding to the presidency
on the chine , on l' iran , on l' aid to israël , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry rivalisent of avoided and méconnaissance .
a america affaiblie by the crise respond gérer a complex society with produce simple , thus simplistes ?
listening to the acceding présidentiels républicains , the électeurs pourraient the belief .
since few jours , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other multiplient the appeared tonitruantes and raccourcis in terms of policy étrangère , traditionnellement a strong républicain .
on the chine , on l' iran , on l' aid to israël , slogans - often not étayés - fusent .
mitt romney , the better placé in the course of the nomination of the " large old party ", has menacé of traîner the chinois face l' omc and the set in case " for manipulation of their monnaie ", a subject porteur in america exaspérée by the migration of entiers sections of his industry towards l' asia .
as pis if this must involvement of the déclenchement d' a guerre commerciale , any said .
jon huntsman , ex-ambassadeur in chine d' obama and only candidat to be an vision of policy étrangère sophistiquée , has failli s' étrangler to a deep appreciation which " flatte " the émotions .
he has man to a dialogue musclé but constructif with pékin ( the current position d' obama ).
but huntsman , which stagne in the profondeurs of sondages , still inaudible .
to l' image of reagan
romney has also promis of frappes militaires on l' iran if the penalties échouent to stopper its programme nucléaire .
" if i am élu , j' arrêterai l' iran , any fanfaronné ."
" if obama is réélu , they auront the explosions ."
it has also promis d' increasing l' militaire aid to israël , accusant obama of faillir to its regulatory to this partenaire .
l' entrepreneur herman cain , second candidat the better placé , affiche comment to combat a méconnaissance embarrassante of dossiers .
much , it appelait to contrer the militaire chinoise menace because pékin " essaie to develop a capacity nucléaire " - apparently ignorant the fact that the chine monopoly l' atome militaire since 1964 !
the governor texan rick perry , which supports israël and wishes of frappes against l' iran , will prêt said , to comment him , to engager l' american army in mexico against the cartels of the drogue .
the recours to the torture against the terroristes présumés , interdit by obama in 2009 is also préconisé by cain , perry and the candidate bachmann michele .
it is loin the candidat républicain of 2008 john mccain , a poids lourd in étrangère policy .
the adversaires of the president répliquent taught us that reagan also had produce simple and qu' it has gagné the guerre froide .
they rappellent qu' obama itself was a amateur and qu' it , set of l' water in his vin legislation d' antiterrorisme .
they insistent with activity on l' failure of his dialogue naïf with l' iran , on the starting too précipité of " boys " d' irak , on its tergiversations in libye , collant him well a étiquette of limited .
but attaque l' n' is not whether aisée .
the population juge positive rather than the bilan of safety nationale d' obama , which has éliminé ben laden .
since l' irak , it méfie of interventions militaires which conduisent to l' enlisement .
and , in arguant qu' it must reconstruire économiquement l' america for ressusciter his leadership , obama frappe more juste .
the north stream , new something d' ntrée the gaz russe in europe
the gazoduc north stream , reliant directly l' europe occidentale russia passant in the form of the sea baltique , is entré into service .
it must be providing the gaz for l' equivalent of 30 million of foyers .
gazprom , the géant gazier russe , has voulu fêter l' événement with éclat .
more 500 attach which four chefs d' state and government have took , last tuesday , on the bords of the baltique , between orchestre and buffet end , to l' inauguration of the north stream , this new gazoduc which relie directly , under the sea , russia to l' germany .
symboliquement , the chancelière allemande angela merkel , president russe dmitri medvedev , the first secretary french françois fillon and his homologue of the netherlands mark rutte have tourné whole the volant the valve commandant l' entry of the gaz russe in the net ouest-européen .
with this new gazoduc , 27,5 billion of mètres cubes of gaz russe additional seem to achieve each year in europe occidentale by a first tube of 1 224 km reliant the area of saint-pétersbourg on land of mecklembourg-poméranie .
a second tube must be complete end 2012 possible to délivrer on total 94/55/ec billion of mètres cubes of gaz , be l' equivalent of any the consumer coup .
and l' it refers already the chance to build schools d' in a third on the same parcours .
for gazprom , l' achèvement in time and in now of this énorme chantier has airs of success .
the draft had been encouraging contesté by the pologne and the countries baltes .
the north stream going word enable of maiden the gaz directly in germany , évitant all systematic terrestre by a third countries ( pologne or ukraine ).
the coup , these two countries perdent a little of their at : it meaning more difficult for them , peser on russia in menaçant of him fermer l' access to markets ouest-européens .
the more strong the debate , varsovie n' had not hésité to comparer the north stream to a " new pacte germano-soviétique ", in reference to l' alliance between hitler and staline for focus the pologne , 1939.
c' is that if the matter is politiquement sensitive .
l' europe of l' ouest , tying its support to this project russe , there gagné a greater safety of its approvisionnements .
but c' is the prices d' a affaiblissement of l' europe of l' energy , since the draft has créé a brèche between european of l' is and l' ouest .
russia has su , five years ago , do triompher its vision d' a alliance directe between russia and the rich countries occidentaux , encouraging consumers of gaz , and the gisements are , in déclin .
this gazoduc " is a composante of our partnership with russia , there is a new artère which links manner organique ", has confirmé françois fillon in inaugurant this gazoduc , démontrant to quel point the major contrats gaziers are also qu' economic policies .
all this explique the broad sourires affichés by leaders of gazprom , présents in number to lubmin , the point of the gaz d' arrivée .
the construction of this gazoduc is also a exploit technical nature .
the tube sous-marin is industry gainé of béton so of the protéger against the ancres of navires .
it repose on the form of the sea , 200 m average .
for the build schools , it has fallu prevent of champs of mines datant of the second guerre mondiale .
" a centaine , be enlevée or destroyed , by précaution ", indicated jens müller , porte-parole society north stream .
it has also fallu multiplier the measures for protéger the faune and the flore .
the tube is a long serpent of métal , lourd as 242 tours eiffel , that nothing n' interrompt on any its lengthy : reliable valve , reliable station of maintenance .
a plate-forme supervisory was planned to the widest of sweden , but the responsible project there have renoncé considering that the suédois depend upon désireux of improve a society d' state russe s' establish manner permanente in the widest of their coasts .
as " d' avarie case , we arrêtons the systematic the gaz in less d' a minute ", says jens müller .
in the case of fuite , the gaz content in the gazoduc s' échappe therefore in l' test .
but this case is jugé little probable scenario by the constructeurs which have exceptional the soudures for knowledge a fuite all the 100 000 years .
the surveillance of l' state of the gazoduc is assurée by a robot sous-marin , traîné by a navire , for l' observation extérieure , as well as by a appareil which circule to internal l' the gazoduc .
the forme d' a cigare , it is introduit to internal l' the tube , widest d' a mètre of diamètre , and it is poussé by the gaz .
to arrivée l' , after three jours complets of voyage to the vitesse of 3 mètres second , it white of environmental require on the éventuelles déformations the métal .
the gazoduc has been conçu for function cinquante years without be to subir the quite frank réparation .
the movement of gaz is simply assurée by the pushes .
it is of 200 bars originally , and 100 to l' arrivée .
five societies have uni their surveys for réaliser this project .
the leader still gazprom , which careful 51% markets .
s' there are added the allemandes e.on and basf ( 15,5% each ), well that the news gasunie and the group gdf french suez ( 9% each ).
these five societies have créé a company common , nommée north stream , chargée to build schools and opérer the gazoduc .
it has its siège to zoug , suisse , where l' imposition is particularly support .
gazprom has then loué to this society , for vingt years energies , the totalité of skills of transport of gaz .
" gazprom paiera for the capacity totale , what that should be the quantité of gaz genuinely transportée ", says jens müller .
the financing of the construction of the gazoduc has been struck to 30% by the actionnaires and 70% by prepared bancaires .
the total costs of business should attain the 7,4 billion d' eur for the two tubes .
for gdf suez , for example , l' direct s' is monté to 240 million .
but the actionnaires minoritaires are reference to rentrer in their frais , since only gazprom assume the military .
the gazoduc émerge of the baltique to lubmin , on a littoral sablonneux planté of pins .
of valves , hautes of 4,5 mètres , form the something of the gaz enforceable .
of capteurs mesurent the pushes , the imagine and the specifics of the gaz which , before qu' it not be transféré in the gazoducs allemands .
since last tuesday , this terminal reçoit a million of mètres cubes of gaz russe to each now which happening .
to industries capacity , this 3 million by now and in 2012 6 million .
moleskine , a carnet of indication .
créé there a quinzaine d' years by a company italienne , the moleskine wishes redonner the goût of l' écriture .
it has a parfum d' aventures , d' p.m. experience to écrire in the light d' a bougie .
the carnet moleskine is facilement reconnaissable , with its couverture rectangulaire spillage , its élastique , its feuilles d' a couleur paper cassé , as vieillies by the time .
however , the carnet moleskine employ qu' it the aware today is né ... in 1997 .
l' business italienne modo modo , basée to milan , basically to l' époque of lancer a carnet of notes design but distingué .
sebregondi maria , considering consultante for l' business , is employees of the lancement of the new product .
the carnet s' inspire d' a technical east of production , the mole skin ( peau of taupe ) which désigne a coton vernis utilisé for couvrir of banquettes example .
this type of carnet was very prisé of écrivains and voyageurs .
" moleskine has remis on goût off the a decide vieux and oublié , which was a icône of artistes avant-gardistes , jusqu'au xx until century " , raconte maria sebregondi , devenue since the responsible indication here modo modo .
the success is .
between 2000-2006 and 2010 the ventes have indeed 26% for s' establish to 12,7 million of pièces obviously .
it is loin of the production confidentielle of initial years , where only 3 000 carnets depend conçus .
moleskine dépasse the borders italiennes and s' exporte in 70 countries , france jusqu'aux ground .
difficult d' establish a portrait-robot of l' acheteur , because the carnet of notes séduit both businessman that l' étudiant and professionnels .
to l' image of moleskine , its consumers are cosmopolites , ouverts d' spirit and cultivés .
the small business italienne , which comptait 12 employés to its débuts , into almost 100 today and dispose since 2008 two bureaux ; l' a to milan and l' other to new york .
it distribue its carnets in the librairies , the fnac to small boutiques of centre-ville and has su imposer his identité .
" we have followed l' test of time and this need new d' écriture , despite l' essor of e-mails " , explique maria sebregondi .
this culturelle signature accompagne the development of moleskine : much , the indication has lancé a exposition " detour " where of architectes or artistes exposent their own carnet .
in août , it has also lancé a couverture in léopard , l' opportunity of festival of the film of locarno .
profitant its success and this will culturelle , moleskine has su diversifier its products : sacs , agenda , stylos , housses d' ordinateur ... indication is décline on a gamme of supports .
a success which has done of envieux : to l' automne 2000-2006 modo modo has been racheté by the funds d' direct sg capital europe , today syntegra capital , écrivant a new page in histoire l' of moleskine .
why the catastrophic unemployment of workers disabled reste-t-il if high ?
environ 19% handicapped people are seeking d' a work .
the 15 until week for l' employment of disabled s' ouvre today .
despite a public policy volontariste implementation in place in 2005 the catastrophic unemployment people handicapped is still high once more that the average : 19% , against 9% l' for the whole of the population .
décourageant ?
" not , out éric blanchet , directeur general of l' adapt , l' association which organise the week for l' employment of disabled . "
" the progress made since quinze years are considerable . "
" to l' époque , the unemployment n' was not two but three times more enough . "
" it still quite is still much to do . "
it must say that for the disabled unemployed , the barriers demeurent many before d' accéder to l' employment .
they are rather than âgés : 37% have more 50 years ( 17% average ).
they disposent d' a level of qualification little high : 80% n' have not the bac and on the 2,3 million d' étudiants of l' higher education , 10 000 only are disabled .
finally , the durée youth unemployment is very répandu : 53% for the disabled , against 38% average .
in short , world of criteria which compliquent especially the retour to l' employment , and which " evolved the nœud of the problem ", according christian grapin , directeur general of tremplin , a association créée in 1992 to assist the companies to recruter of workers disabled .
so much for the freins objectives .
still the non-dit , the mentalités which évoluent , though , but too lentement .
a étude réalisée in avril by l' association ims-entreprendre for the quoted indiquait that the managers interrogés have " a level of familiar limited the ", handicap with a " surreprésentation of people chaise roulante , déficients psychiques or intellectuels ".
result , companies privées more of 20 salariés are still loin d' achieved l' objective d' employment of 6% of workers disabled , set in a loi of 1987. ...
the latest uk connus , which datent of 2008 refuse state d' a ratio of 2,6% .
" we are now focused on 3% ", indicated pierre paper , directeur general of l' agefiph , l' body responsible for collecter the contributions of companies which fail this loi .
the proof : the number établissements " d' taxés ", all as the montants versés , have decreased between 2007 and 2011 passant 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and 606 to 480 million d' ). eur
" the loi of 2005 which augmentait the contributions , has créé a pushes forte on companies , explique pierre paper . "
" but this also improving form a true taken in conscience , particularly in the major groups . "
according to the prosecutor of l' employment , only 59% of établissements of 20 to 49 salariés emploient of workers disabled , against 82% companies of 100 to 199 salariés .

has l' goes , the two équipes had manqué of réalisme .
" has the end of these 90 minutes , we serons a équipe heureuse and , especially , a heureux countries ".
paulo bento s' there voit already , pologne and in ukraine .
for him , it n' there l' ombre d' a doubt , the selecçao , which it is to manettes since september 2010 going to take qualifier for l' euro 2012.
portugal n' is actually qu' to 90 minutes of bonheur .
but there is a match to using , and a adversaire , the bosnie , to déboulonner .
looking at the match goes ( 0 - 0 ), friday in l' province of zenica , it apparait genuine link that the jeux are not facts .
portugal has dominé the proposals during more d' a now , though , but it was incapable of marquer this objective if valuable , which might soulagé l' .
" c' is a sound result , which comporte but a pity military because we n' have not characterised of approving to l' trade "
but among them , in their lumineux stage of the luz to lisbonne , the portugais are convaincus of passer , face a public which should be where also bouillant , even if the proposals s' annonce course " very serrée ", dixit a bento optimiste but lucide .
" we looking at a very serré match , but we are quite convaincus to be able to take the dessus ", has declared l' entraîneur portugais of 42 years .
" we continue to be 50% of opportunities d' be to l' euro 2012 ", did relativisé the successeur of carlos queiroz .
the nul rapporté friday of bosnie fact means the portugais to marquer and gagner .
a nul can suffire to bosniens , which have also assume needs marquer .
" c' is a sound result , which comporte but a pity military because we n' have not characterised of approving to l' trade ", regrette bento .
" we shall using against a équipe which has many of qualités techniques and which dispose of joueurs with many of qualités individuelles ", any deficiencies .
as to zenica , the portugais auront l' intention to establish d' entry a maximum of pushes bosniens so of " do not have the time of reflect . "
a good idea , to condition of is set realistic , this time .
